Another recommendation - look into Niacinamide... Vitamin B3 - it is very inexpensive, but acts very similarly to Xanax and other benzos with no side effects, but plenty of side-benefits. Valium was originally created by trying to mimic the effect of Niacinamide.

As an experiment I bought a bundle of carrots, celery and a bag of onions and one day I processed them all through my food processor. I then spread each one flat on a cookie sheet to freeze and finally poured each one into their own gallon ziplock and put it in the freezer. When I need a mirpoix I just get a scoop of each. I also use the onions on pizza as it seems to make them more oniony. I suppose the texture suffers somewhat but the convenience can't be beat.

How about a 30 minute, healthy, meal? Get one of [these or something similar](http://www.amazon.com/Secura-Stainless-Electric-technology-S-324/dp/B004MKG8H8/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1422025804&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=3+tier+steamer). It's a 3 tier steamer. When you get home put white rice in the bottom tier and set for 10 minutes. When it dings add the thawed chicken breasts to the second tier and set for 10 minutes. When it dings add broccoli or other fresh veggies to the top tier and set for 10 minutes. When it dings you've got perfect rice, healthy chicken breast and veggies on just this side of done (I like my broccoli to fight back just a little.) You can then use: teriyaki, Franks hot sauce and feta, hoisin, BBQ, honey mustard or whatever other sauce you want. Works with fish and steamed fresh mushrooms are awesome. You can dust with lemon pepper, paprika, regular pepper or whatever other seasonings you want. Infinitely variable. If you want some crunch you can be naughty. I will, sometimes, mix butter crackers and melted butter then put the steamed breast in a pan, cover with the crackers then broil until unicorn tears form.

You can make ahead:

Rice. Pull out of the freezer and microwave in a covered dish until done. Not perfect but perfect enough.

Ground beef (brown a bunch, drain and freeze. Keep the fat. To use pull out however much you want and add a little of the grease back in.) Great for taco meat (just start from where you've browned the beef) Toss in with some frozen marinara (you did make up a batch of that right?) Sprinkle with some italian seasoning on pizza, mix with mac n' cheese for a beefy mac.

Bacon. I make 1 Lb of bacon at a time (save the grease...duh.) Eat my fill then put the rest in the freezer. It is great on pizza, potatoes or other dishes where bacon is a supporting player.

Containers of a plain marinara frozen are awesome. When you get home toss the frozen sauce in a pot. Add meat, some frozen onions, some frozen green peppers and set on low to med. Go change out of the work duds, mix a drink, turn on the TV, kick the cat. Okay, now nuke or heat in a pan some pre-cooked pasta-cicles OR just boil some water and toss in a handful of fresh for 8 minutes or boxed for 10-12 minutes. 

Chili reheats really well as does stew and most soups (cream based can get odd).

I hope these help and that at least one of them is a new idea for you!",65,t1_cnycfxz,mrhoopers,0,65,1422026942,t5_2qh7f,0,Cooking

It's the standard. Unless you're a compiler writer or a huge language nerd, you probably have no use for the standard.

You'd still want to learn from typical books, such as *The C++ Programming Language* (by the language's creator). You'd have to wait for them to be updated, though. The finished standard is very new, so you can expect a bit of a wait for many books to be updated. Granted, it's been a WIP for some time, and there's already some books available (such as [Effective Modern C++](http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Modern-Specific-Ways-Improve/dp/1491903996)) and compilers already support a number of the latest features (at least Clang and GCC do; Visual Studio tends to be behind).",24,t1_cnp3sp5,the_omega99,0,24,1421271562,t5_2fwo,0,programming

Today I was at Sportsman's Warehouse and saw a 0 F rated Slumberjack Latitude for $56.  That's dirt cheap hypothermia insurance.  I have the -20 F version of the same bag (about $65) in my kit.  I consider it the centerpiece of my kit.  I store it loose in an oversized bag so it doesn't get compressed and lose its warmth.  I have a bivy in my kit also (OR Highland) to keep the rain off and protect me from the wet ground, but I need more than that in cold weather.  Also consider a torso-length Thermarest in case you ever have to sleep on snow.  Compresses very small.

I don't see any rain gear.  You can still get hypothermia traveling from point A to B if you're getting rained on all day in cold weather.  Also your gear will get soaked.  Go fabric not plastic if you can, because rips.

Also [pruning saw](http://www.amazon.com/Silky-Folding-Landscaping-POCKETBOY-346-17/dp/B0014C7XS0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420965125&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=silky+pocketboy) &gt; wire saw if you really need to cut some wood.

In fact, he argues that coming together as a community potentially was the source of our ability to reason: one must be able to make reasonable assumptions about the actions and feelings of others to keep the peace.

Similarly, a $30 Parker badger hair brush does the exact same thing as a $200 brush.

Historically, safety razors started out as a cheap shaving solution to save money from getting shaves from barbers and save time from doing it yourself via straight razors. Like anything vintage/retro, this sort of thing has been fetishized by the internet and there are loads of guides out there singing the praises of all sorts of ""premium"" safety razor gear which seriously just epitomizes the mindset of ""Well I paid more for this so of course it's better.""

https://www.amazon.com/Bloody-Shirt-Terror-After-Civil/dp/0452290163,,The Bloody Shirt: Terror After the Civil War,"But the U.S. Civil war did devolve into a protracted guerrilla war. 
The guerrilla war led directly to the establishment of Jim Crow. Between 1865 and 1877 when Federal troops left the south under a deal (known as the compromise of 1877) to end the contested election of 1876, there was constant if not always armed opposition to Scallywags (Southerners who supported reconstruction), carpetbaggers (Northerners who came to the South in support of reconstruction) and black political leaders who attempted to run the South and preserve freed blacks basic civil rights. 

For example, in 1874 fighting broke out in Arkansas in what is known as the [Brooks-Baxter War](http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2276) where radical Republicans and Democrats fought over the rightful winner of the 1874 governor's election. The defeat of the Republicans led to the end of the reconstruction era in Arkansas. That same year Democrats attacked radical Republicans in New Orleans in the [Battle of Liberty Place](http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2276) which also led to the end of reconstruction in Louisiana.

Then there's the emergence of the Klu Klux Klan, a loose network of guerrilla warriors (today we might even call them terrorists), that was formed in Tennessee in 1866 and engaged in a sustained campaign of bombing, political assassinations, lynchings, voter intimidation and other actions to wrest control of the South from radical republicans and return control of political institutions to white Democrats. The federal government responded to Klan violence with [the Enforcement acts](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/jimcrow/stories_events_enforce.html), which allowed the federal government to intervene if black civil rights were being violated. The Enforcement Act of 1871 is known informally as the ""Klu Klux Klan"" law. The Klan was eventually defeated and a different Klan emerged in the early 20th century. 

In the end, the sustained guerrilla campaign was a success. Radical republicans were purged from the state government, black voting rights were eliminated and white Democrats would have basically unchallenged control in the South until 1965, when passage of the Voting Rights Act finally resulted in the registration of millions of black voters in the South.

I suggest going through and quickly gathering garbage, sweeping the floor and then assessing.

Go through your make-up and toss anything old. It's not hygienic to keep old mascara/eye products, etc and I really doubt you need that entire white drawer thing for make-up unless you're a make-up artist or something. Go through the kitchen and toss anything expired. Buy a small collapsible step stool so you can access the cabinets. Really think through how you use your kitchen and buy items that are multipurpose. Can you pare down your pots and pans? You could use the wall the garbage is against to hang pots if needed. How often to you use your microwave? Can you justify having one? The pantry sucks, no getting around it. I suggest buying square containers for dry goods, like your rice, beans, etc so they are upright instead of flopping over on everything else.  The pantry looks deep, but stuff will get buried in the back if you can't see it, so maybe use some shoeboxes or something in the back to elevate things that go in the back. Or get those [wire shelf](http://www.amazon.com/Grayline-40710-Jumbo-Kitchen-Helper/dp/B000LNVXIY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1421684114&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=wire+shelf+rack)things.

Your closets are totally being underutilized....where are the clothes?  Wash all the laundry, sort through it, and start hanging stuff up. You may be able to free up a drawer in your dresser that could be used for something else. Looks like there's room for a shelf above the current closet shelf - again, get a trusty collapsible step stool. The wall in the closet would be a prime place to hang a vertical shoe rack. This [over the door style](http://www.amazon.com/Whitmor-6082-13-Natural-Storage-Organizer/dp/B002OEJ77W/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1421684292&amp;sr=8-11&amp;keywords=hanging+storage+shoes) could easily just be hung on a wall instead of over a door.

I'd work on those things, and then do a major purge, and then look into other storage - you may find out you don't need as much extra storage as you think. ",12,t1_cntwh6t,gettingzen,0,12,1421684434,t5_2ustf,0,declutter

However, one thing I will say is that it would be interesting if this data took into consideration how many years into the bull market the market was. Cuz think about it. it makes sense that ~66% of the time you are better off investing all your money because the market's general trend is upwards. However, the longer into a bull market one gets (tautologically) the closer you are to a bear market. So, to me, it would be interesting to see a chart showing how the percentage changes every additional year into a bull market... unless I am think about this wrong. 

In Jeremy Siegel's most recent addition of [Stocks for the Long Run](http://www.amazon.com/Stocks-Long-Run-Definitive-Investment/dp/0071800514) he explains that there has never been a time when an investor in the US market didn't make money on an investment left for over a decade.

On that note, it seems like there's a possibility that the [A10](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchild_Republic_A-10_Thunderbolt_II) will end up like that as well, because even though there's always talk about it getting canceled (even Rumsfeld talked about ending it IIRC) [it keeps getting sent into combat](http://www.wired.com/2014/12/a10-warthog-isis/).

It depends on the road quality in your area, but even my road bike gets 25mm.  I like 28 or 32 (usually 32) on my commuter.

I have a shorter knife than most guys, so I went with the Fleshlight Flight. It's smaller and more compact. It feels really good, and is a dramatic difference from the more traditional masturbation method.

I was worried about the same thing, and as with anything else there are pros and cons to buying this. Here are some things to keep in mind:

**Pros**

- Feels very good
- Fairly priced considering how long it lasts
- Feels very very good

**Cons**

- Cleaning can be annoying. Just use warm water and let it air out. You have to not mind touching your own man-batter.
- You may have people find it. It sucks just knowing other people know, it feels embarrassing, even though it shouldn't. I just keep it in a box in a drawer.

**Tips**

- If you do get one, don't pay for their lube. The material needs [water based lube](http://www.amazon.com/K-Y-Personal-Lubricant-Jelly-Ounce/dp/B00070J2H0/ref=sr_1_7?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1421966715&amp;sr=1-7&amp;pebp=1421966749205&amp;peasin=B00070J2H0), which you can get elsewhere, and their's is very slick and can get everywhere.
- When you clean it, there is no need to turn it inside out. If you do, it will eventually destroy the material. Just use warm water, rinse it out thoroughly and let it air out. I usually pat dry it with a paper towel or something.
- Eventually, especially if you use it a lot (which you will for a while), it will get sticky. The material simply starts to break down due to oils, so you need to keep it soft. To do this, buy corn starch when you notice it getting sticky and put a bunch on it, then rub it around. This returns it back to the way it felt when you got it. Let it sit for about a day, then rinse it out before you use it again.

If you have any more questions let me know. They seriously are worth it. They feel so damned good, and while they aren't the real deal, at least it's better than your hand and losing a ton of money on dates.",11,t1_cnxor7a,redvoice,0,11,1421967147,t5_2s30g,0,AskMen
https://www.amazon.com/Protection-Reversal-Magick-Beyond-101/dp/1564148793,,Protection and Reversal Magick (Beyond 101),"I usually frame it between the two “everythings”: Context and Intent.  
  
**Context is everything**. What does your paradigm tell you? What do you make of the [observer effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_%28physics%29)? Our influence over the phenomenological universe doesn’t stop at the end of our fingers. You obviously intuited this to some extent since you’re posting to /r/occult. I think skepticism is healthy and you should, naturally, subject all the elements of your paradigm to the degree of rigor you find appropriate.  
  
Likewise…  
  
**Intent is everything**. I think you’re right about it being short-sighted to assume that only positive ideations have any kind of effect. Ever tried smiling or frowning for a few minutes at your own reflection? Moods are a tenuous construct. There’s an old Buddhist teaching that says (and I’m paraphrasing) holding onto negative emotions is like grabbing a fistful of hot coals in order to cast them at your enemy. You may indeed strike them and they may suffer some injury, but *you **certainly** will*.  
  
So, I think it’s perhaps just as apt a question to consider that, even if curse magick is “real” what should your relationship to it be? It makes more sense, therefore, to a) familiarize oneself with defensive tactics against curse magick and to b) walk a path that does not put one in the position to *have* to defend against it.  
  
The first one brings Jason Miller’s “[Protection and Reversal Magick](http://www.amazon.com/Protection-Reversal-Magick-Witchs-Defense/dp/1564148793/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_a)” to mind. The second isn’t an injunction to be some milquetoast sweetness-and-light-er. I’m suggesting, instead, that each of us contains within ourselves enough “enemies” trying to “curse” us for a thousand lifetimes. Focusing on these elements will be much more fruitful than worrying about curse magick.",15,t1_cnc4o8z,wordtempletarot,0,15,1420207712,t5_2qhmc,0,occult

The peak of the empire is often considered to have happened in 1520-1566 under Sulaiman the Magnificent and gradually declined in power from this point onward. Like all complex situations, there were several issues that caused the decline of the Ottoman Empire but I will be only examining economics and military aspects related to actions with Europe. I gathered my information from [Peter Mansfield's](http://www.amazon.com/History-Middle-East-Fourth/dp/0143121901/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420509213&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=peter+mansfield+a+history+of+the+middle+east) book, 'A History of the Middel East'.

During the medieval era, Europe experienced a time of both economic and social stagnation. This was not the case in areas controlled by the Ottoman Empire (most of which is geographically considered the Middle East). Reasons for Ottoman dominance can be traced to the powerful system the sultans maintained over their empire. Sultans held great power and used it to create a strict institution based on the preservation of Ottoman culture. With little political resistance against the sultan, he was allowed to keep the empire on track and prosperous while neighboring European countries were lost in disorganization. 

Mansfield argued that the tide of dominance between the Ottoman Empire and Europe begins to change in the 1600's because of the emergence of capitalism. Feudal societies are often attributed as the first steps towards modern capitalism and could be seen in effect in many places throughout Europe. The Ottoman Empire did not begin this development as early as Europe because of overconfidence amongst the Arab and Turkish people and also because of the rigid and ultra-conservative control by the sultans. Throughout the centuries, the Ottoman Empire began to decline in economic terms compared to Europe and its more efficient capitalist system. In order to reverse this trend, Ottoman sultans attempted to open up the Turkish economy for European investors. Many deals, known as the Capitulations, were made with European nations that allowed European merchants to move more freely within the Ottoman Empire. Examples of certain Capitulations includes European citizens not being help to laws in the empire ( which operated mostly under Sharia law) and paying very few taxes.

Mansfield concluded that through economic means Europe was able to peacefully infiltrate into an empire that they saw as hostile and slowly weaken it. Europe was able to further outpace the empire because of the one-sided trade environment that was created. It also didn't help that many European merchants abused the Capitulations by breaking laws or avoiding the minuscule tax all together. By the 1900's, the Ottoman Empire was only able to continue to exist because of European nations propping it up. The empire was able to last until the end of the First World War because European powers feared its collapse would cause a power vacuum which would lead to a sort of European civil war. After WWI this sort of became irrelevant because of Germany's collapse. France and Britain also wanted land holdings in the Middle East and had no moral problems carving up their vanquished Ottoman foe into different spheres through the Sykes-Picot agreement.",39,t1_cnfr028,rabidpenguin3,0,39,1420510950,t5_2ssp3,0,AskHistorians

You can always try being more affectionate with kitty. Is kitty a lap kitty? hold kitty in your lap, maybe brush her if she enjoys that, anything that is soothing and enjoyable. Try wrapping kitty in soft blanket, for most cats, this provides a feeling of safety (warning: not all cats respond well to this). Does kitty have a scratching post/cat house/climbing tree? Try laser pointer with kitty for activity periods. If all else fails and kitty does not grow out of this behavior, seek the help of a vet and see about some medication that will provide some relaxation time for kitty. Maybe see about getting some kind of moving distraction for the cat.

People are masters of saying, I'm not X, I'm just X-1.  ""I'm not an alcoholic; I'm just a guy who likes a fifth of scotch with breakfast.""  ""I'm not a wife beater; that bitch just needs to learn some respect.""  ""I'm not a sexist, I just think neuroscience proves men are better.""

The reasoning starts something like this: A ""racist"" is a monster, and I'm not a monster, so I'm not racist.  And if I'm not a racist, then there must be some other reason why I believe these things.  Maybe I'll claim to hate everyone equally.  Maybe I'll rely on religion.  Maybe I'll say I truly believe in separate but equal.

There's a reason racist forums spend so much time posting about ""evidence"" that supports their beliefs.  They feel that if they can ""prove"" it, then they're just realists, not racists.  (Conversely, you'll notice that /r/biology doesn't spend an inordinate amount of time posting evidence that genes are the main mode of inheritance.  They believe it, but they're don't need to be defensive about it.)

So, yeah, there might be some people on there who think of themselves as ""racist"", but I'm guessing most of them would say they are not.

Yes, I was abusive to my SO when I was undiagnosed and untreated.  However, that doesn't mean I'm some sort of heartless evil human being.  

See, the problem is, SJWs see abusers as evil.  They live in a black or white world, where you're either good or evil.  This is not accurate- the world is shades of grey.

It wasn't my fault I was abusive to my SO.  I was extremely sick and dealing with extreme, chronic emotional pain the only way I knew how.  I did not intend to hurt anyone and was reacting to what I perceived my reality to be.  That also doesn't mean I didn't hurt people.

The dialectic!  Things can be good and bad at the same time. 

*Stop Walking On Eggshells* was a very difficult read and I do not recommend it to anyone.  It was updated recently to be less discriminatory towards BPD (the older version perpetrated the myth that BPD is untreatable and incurable).  I still don't like it much.  *I Hate You - Don't Leave Me* and *Sometimes I Act Crazy* are much better alternatives.

For people who want quality coffee and are low on budget, low on space, and low on need for volume, the Aeropress is great.

That being said, mine sits in the cabinet and makes an occasional appearance to show new 'coffee people' an inexpensive interesting little brewing device.  Meanwhile, my Kalita Wave, Woodneck, Technivorm, espresso machine, and Yama tower get used to death.

The Aeropress does offer more versatility in brew techniques than an immersion dripper because of the ability to press the brew through fine grinds which would plug a dripper's filter.  Many extractions can be created with the Aeropress which wouldn't be possible when relying on gravity to drain the brew through a paper filter.

I have a [Clever Coffee Dripper](http://www.amazon.com/Coffee-Shrub-Clever-Dripper/dp/B00EOM5RN0) (a lower cost plastic version of your Bonavita) which I spent quite some time experimenting with, but it sees little use now.  For new 'quality coffee people' who own poor quality autodrip brewers, an immersion dripper is an inexpensive, simple method to introduce them to better quality brews.  Due to the decreased demand for attention and time, immersion drippers would also be great for production-line style individual cup brewing in a shop.

However, I pretty much just look at it as a labor saver.  It's convenient and easy, and it regularly produces above average results, but never anything I would really call special.  Personally, I would rather put more effort into a great pourover or a French press which I am really going to enjoy, than drink an average immersion drip.  No offense intended, just my opinion.

""Campagne"" em francês significa ""do campo"", no sentido de ""do interior"" ou ""do meio rural"". A tradução correta em português seria pão de camponês ou pão rústico.

Se for feito do jeito certo é um pão que tem uma fermentação mais demorada que o pão normal e usa fermentos selvagens e é exposto ao ar para pegar mofos e bactérias, intencionalmente. Conforme os mofos e fermentos usados ele tem um gosto diferente, em geral mais fermentado e com uma textura mais dura que o pão normal. Em inglês é chamado de Sourdough.

https://www.amazon.com/Workbenches-Design-Construction-Popular-Woodworking/dp/1558708405,,Workbenches: From Design And Theory To Construction And Use (Popular Woodworking),"This bench is a poor choice for hand tools--it more of a workbench for a homeowner who needs to organize maintenance supplies, or someone who primarily uses power tools

For hand tools, really want something more traditional. Something that weighs at least 300lbs. Something with tree-trunks for legs that won't rack or walk all over the room when you put some oomph behind a jointer plane. Something that doesn't have a bunch of crud hanging above your head that will fall on you when you are putting your muscle into something.

[This DVD from Mike Siemsen](http://lostartpress.com/products/the-naked-woodworker) walks you through how to build a workbench for very, very limited money--$150-175 is feasible. It's an English design that doesn't require vises for work holding.

[This video series from Paul Sellers](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD39949332C7FB168) walks you through building a reasonable workbench with a very limited set of hand tools and inexpensive materials. This is also an under-$200 bench.

[This book](http://www.amazon.com/Workbenches-Design-Construction-Popular-Woodworking/dp/1558708405), and [also this one](http://www.amazon.com/The-Workbench-Design-Book-Philosophy/dp/1440310408/ref=pd_sim_b_1?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=125A635CPDEVYPYR7SG3) by Chris Schwarz represent a deep dive into workbench design. The books include plans for ten or so different benches, all of which are excellent for hand tool work. I built [my bench](http://imgur.com/a/masMV) based on plans in the second book. [Schwarz also has a blog](http://www.popularwoodworking.com/woodworking-blogs/chris-schwarz-blog) which, if you go through past years, contains hundreds of posts on workbench design.

Workbenches don't have to be expensive. You can use 2x8s or 2x10s from the home center and limited tools to build them. The first two benches I linked come in at under $200. Schwarz's have a bit more of a range. In general, if you chose inexpensive lumber and hardware, your bench shouldn't cost more than a few hundred bucks. 

One last thing: if you're doing it by hand, use a softwood. One of the stiffer/harder/heavier ones like Douglas-Fir or Southern Yellow Pine. Avoid the mystery SPF/whitewood. Not saying you can't make a hardwood bench completely by hand, but it's a lot more sweat, time, and money, and the bench doesn't really work any better once it's done.",11,t1_cnzjurv,abnormal_human,0,11,1422127735,t5_2qlqp,0,woodworking

https://www.amazon.com/Power-Myth-Joseph-Campbell/dp/0385418868,,The Power of Myth,"*Joseph Campbell.


One key thing to remember: Campbell's work is *descriptive*, not *prescriptive*.  What I mean is that he was describing and interpreting the trends that he found in mostly ancient folklore, myths, and legends.  He had no intention of creating a formula for storytellers to refer to, although this is now common practice.  


Also, ""Star Wars closely follows the monomyth"" is really not a topic.  You need to answer the ""So what?"" question.  Why did Lucas do that?  Where does he deviate from the monomyth?  How does he use these common trends to tell a unique story?  How does it reflect the time in which it was produced?  You don't have to answer all of these questions, but you do need to address something beyond simply plugging in Star Wars characters and situations where appropriate.


You should probably seek out the Joseph Campbell-Bill Moyers collaboration *[The Power of Myth](http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Myth-Joseph-Campbell/dp/0385418868)*.  Lots of libraries have a copy.  It is much, much easier to digest than Campbell's original work, unless you are already familiar with a great number of myths and extensive academic terminology.  The tv series by the same name is pretty good, as well.  For a book that uses Campbell's monomyth but updates it with examples from modern media (and a prescriptive purpose), [pick this up](http://www.amazon.com/The-Writers-Journey-Structure-Edition/dp/193290736X/ref=pd_sim_b_12?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=1S87KZ5D9F2JDQVA24DG).

Below is a step-by-step plan for people like you.  I have tried to pick reasonably short, highly readable books where the mathematics is at least correct (which is unfortunately often a lot to ask for). I assume you have full command of graduate level-math, including probability and even stochastic calculus. My general approach is to steer clear of the revered behemothic books (Casella and Berger, MacKay, Hastie and Tibshirani, etc.). No one reads those anyway - people are too busy singing their praises online after glancing over the table of contents and giving them 5 stars on Amazon. They are more advanced equivalents of Stewart's Calculus: tons of words that you can distil into a few basic skills. Reading them indiscriminately can be detrimental to learning, because as a newcomer you don't know what is important and what is not, so you can easily waste a lot of time on things that, although they may seem interesting, are of lesser importance nowadays (e.g. intricate computations using exponential families, Fisher efficiency, etc.)

Always choose lectures notes over books, and choose *short* tutorials, followed by more in depth reading over lecture notes: your attention span is precious. Read about applications and methodology, and take a practical approach whenever possible. You know math, so you can work things out for yourself for the most part. In general, statistics book will have little to teach you except for the basic ideas - almost any ""technical"" arguments in statistics texts will be a joke if you are used to research-level math. Finally, you have to make at least a minimum of effort learning about computational implementations, and I don't mean doing *t*-tests by hand using tables.

* *Setting the mood*: Look at **[Michael Hardy](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/31655/statistics-for-mathematicians)**'s response to a ""statistics for mathematicians"" question on mathoverflow a while ago. Read Wikipedia until you understand all the words, and get a feeling for what statistics is about. This should take no more than a couple of hours.

* *Fisherian parametric theory/basic jargon* **[Panchenko's notes](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-443-statistics-for-applications-fall-2003/lecture-notes/18443.pdf)** for his MIT Statistics for Applications class cover the basics and are elementary, but the derivations are mathematical. Everything is very easy, but you need to understand everything in there as clearly as you understand calculus right now.

* *Methodology/Programming*. **[Shalizi's](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/ADAfaEPoV.pdf)** methodology course from CMU (free, almost complete draft linked) is pretty nice. It uses R, and should get you acquainted with most of the ""real word techniques"" you should know. Do at least some of the programming problems. It's a little too long for my taste, and he has a tendency to get philosophical (although the remarks are always interesting). If in a hurry, try reading just I.1-3, I.6, I.7, I.12, I.13, skip II and learn density estimation and PCA from somewhere else (too much text), III.23-25. Finally skim through, and take to heart, his remarks about time series in IV. (Basically, the AR(I)MA linear theory is beautiful math but you can safely ignore it in practice unless your boss says otherwise). For some lighter reading, try **[this](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)**. Do not start reading Hastie and Tibshirani's *Elements*. It's a good reference, but ultimately the most useful part of that book is the table of contents: in a year, you should at least vaguely know what all the words mean. Their treatment of most topics is too involved to get a quick overview on first approach, and they discuss so many topics that at lot of them are not done in enough depth to answer specific questions you might have when working on a particular problem. For example, their *p&gt;N* chapter is completely inadequate to cover what is probably the most important topic in both research and applications nowadays.

* *Modern mathematical statistics*. The emphasis here is on modern. Too many theory books spend an awful amount of time on Fisher efficiency-based parametric theory and Neyman-Pearson. That stuff is light-years from most current applications. For (otherwise fine) examples of what I mean see [this](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-466-mathematical-statistics-spring-2003/lecture-notes/) or [this](http://www.amazon.com/Theory-Statistics-Springer-Series/dp/0387945466). This is in addition to being gigantic, which as you will have noticed, is a sin I have little patience for. My recommendation is to read **[this new (short, realistic) book on minimax theory](http://www.ams.org/bookstore-getitem/item=gsm-119) by Korostelev and Korosteleva**. Actually, if you only have time for a single book out of everything here, let it be that one. To strengthen your theory, read Chapters 3,4,5,7,8 and 13 of **[van der Waart](http://www.amazon.com/Asymptotic-Statistics-Statistical-Probabilistic-Mathematics/dp/0521784506#reader_0521784506)**. Also read Chapter 2 if you don't remember modes of convergence from probability or if you need a refresher on various forms of the central limit theorem. Supplement your reading with later chapters as needed.  These [online notes](http://www.math.nankai.edu.cn/~chlzou/as_print.pdf) should also cover most of your asymptotic needs. Once again, stay away from the ""giants"" like Lehmann. They are only references.

* *Non-parametrics*. [Tsybakov](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Nonparametric-Estimation-Springer-Statistics/dp/0387790519) is a short, mathematical introduction to density and process estimation, and is divided in such a way that it can be read selectively. Do not bother with bigger books. Instead, learn about **Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney, Kruskall-Wallis** and non-parametric **bootstraps** from the internet, or read the relevant chapters in van der Waart, Shalizi, or **[here](http://math.nankai.edu.cn/~chlzou/Notes.pdf)**. Johnstone also has a decent nonparametric estimation book online, mostly about Gaussian processes.

* *Bayesian* **[Gelman](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/)**. Yes, it's a big classic, but by this time you probably have some idea of how Bayesian works anyway, so you can read selectively. **Christian Robert's ""The Bayesian Choice""** is often given as an alternative, but it's even bigger. You can read Robert's intro and his final chapter (an ""apology"" for Bayesian statistics) for his viewpoint on philosophy of the discipline, especially with respect to the frequentist/Bayesian debate. Try [this book by Efron](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/statistics-probability/statistical-theory-and-methods/large-scale-inference-empirical-bayes-methods-estimation-testing-and-prediction) for an interesting, applications driven take on multiple testing.

* *Cool topic at the intersection of math and stats*. **[Compressed sensing](http://rauhut.ins.uni-bonn.de/LinzRauhut.pdf)**. For more math in that general vein, look **[here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5103)**.

Fun fact: Narwhals practice dentistry! It's normally the younger, subordinate narwhals practicing on the older, senior narwhals. If a senior narwhal has his horn broken then the main nerve is exposed and shit hurts. A subordinate narhwhal will proceed to break off a small section of his tooth into the open hole of the senior's tooth creating a ""filling"" of sorts.

Edit: I'm actually not joking, I'm being serious. I'm going to try and find a good source for you guys--give me a few.

Edit 2: This is from a Marine Mammal Biology textbook written E.C.M. Parsons. He's an amazing guy who really knows his stuff. Its titled *An Introduction to Marine Mammal Biology and Conservation*...

Here is an excerpt:

&gt; ""A type of dentistry may be practiced among narwhals in that the broken tusk of one individual may be plugged with the tip of another's tusk. Although some have described this as being the result of ""head-on collisions"", this is unlikely considering the accuracy that would have to be involved (or, more precisely, the extremely low probability of such collisions occurring coincidentally). Because this ""capping"" of the tusk is unlikely to have happened by chance, it is possible that this is an altruistic act. There are accounts by Arctic indigenous people of seeing young narwhals aligning the tips of their tusks with the broken tusks of older males and, apparently, deliberately snapping the very tips of their tusks off to block open tooth cavities. A narwhal's tusk is hollow and filled with pulp and contains a sizeable nerve, which is exposed would presumably be extremely painful. One could see why this unusual behavior might develop in a social cetacean species. roken tusks have also been found with the tips crammed with sand and gravel, perhaps from an attempt to cap the broken tusk by jamming the broken tooth into the seabed.""

&gt;I have a bit of graduate training in economics

considering Austrians are basically a joke in academia. This whole post is borderline /r/badeconomics territory, Fed / Fractional Reserve stuff gets posted there all the time, because people are usually incorrect about it. You keep pointing out things like,

&gt;Because they model the economy without money, as if it were a barter system, mainstream economists fail to realize...that when money is created, it is never distributed evenly throughout the population

That's not even close to remotely true. Honestly, I hate to be that guy but your understanding of the Fed and fractional reserve system is pretty poor.

&gt;If the money is ""lent"" out 10 times, then you can calculate that the total amount of money created if $500: 5 times more than the original amount that the Fed created when the first bank borrowed from it.

It's actually $457.05, and has a limit at $500 (the more iterations, the closer it gets, but it wont pass it). This is essentially the money multiplier, it's not a bad thing.

&gt;So essentially, the entire system is set up for no good reason, it only serves itself

This is also not remotely true. Have you ever gotten a loan from a bank? 

&gt;and it is completely raping the working class.

The only causal link you've made for this is that they experience inflation the worst. I'm curious what metrics your using to measure the raping of the working class, depending on what you're looking at, things are pretty much better than ever for most Americans.

* [Wooden hangers.](http://www.amazon.com/Whitmor-6026-715-16-Natural-Collection-Hangers/dp/B0069RX816/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1421688304&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=wooden+hangers) Seriously. Get rid of your shitty-ass wire and plastic hangers, and invest in something decent. You will thank me. Stack them on a shelf when not hanging an item.

* Only wear the dress clothes when you're working. Take them off as soon as you come home. 

* Have 2 identical pairs of black shoes, and 2 pairs of brown shoes. This lets them ""rest"" a day between wears.

* Same above rule, but for black / brown belts. Get good ones.

* If you find a shirt that looks good, buy 6 of them. 

* As they get dirty, move them to a dry clean category in the closet. Don't wad them up -- hang them up on your wooden hangers.

* Professional laundry only. The only time it pays to iron is in a hotel room.

* [Tie Grenades](http://www.cufflinksdepot.com/p/76BB578B/Travel+Tie+Case.html?utm_source=googlebase&amp;utm_medium=googlebase&amp;utm_term=76BB578B&amp;gclid=CjwKEAiA8_KlBRD9z_jl_fKBhQkSJABDKqiX9Xws6cV7VI8Zq6ZgQvSKYyMirN7HZyH3IgMCv-lhzxoC9Q_w_wcB) are what I call the travel containers for ties. Best for flying with dress clothes.

* [""Shirt Shuttle""](http://www.patrona.com/the-shuttle-series/shirt-shuttle.html) is good for having a fresh shirt in your car or carry-on. 

* Polish them shoes, muthafucka.

* Only buy shoes that cost $100+. 

* [Shoe rubbers](http://www.amazon.com/Totes-Mens-Rubber-Footwear-Overshoes/dp/B000WNE1PU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1421688014&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=shoe+rubbers) are a must for the winter salt. A MUST.

* All watches, tie bars, cuff links, etc. go in their own place. If you take them off not in your house, have a special pocket in your briefcase for them.

* If you carry a gun (American here), don't do it every day with your suit. It wears holes in your suit pants. [Carry in your briefcase.](http://www.condoroutdoor.com/images/products/detail/153_003_pistol.jpg)

* When you get to a hotel, take your shirts out and hang in the bathroom. Turn off the fan, and run hot shower for 20 minutes with the door closed. Some wrinkles will come out.

* [Metal collar stays](http://www.amazon.com/Stainless-Steel-Collar-Stays-Plastic/dp/B00EUT4S6E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1421688154&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=collar+stays) are cheap and effective. (But get buzzed by TSA magnetic wands, FYI.) 

* Medium starch.

* [Custom-made shirts are best](http://www.paulfredrick.com/CustomShirts/PFCustomShirt.aspx?sc=S5NPPB&amp;redirect=true), if you can afford. 

* BOGO at Men's Wearhouse and Joseph A Banks are great for ties, but their suits are cheap. You should have a couple of nicer custom suits if you can afford them. 

* [Ditch the closet rack](http://www.amazon.com/Friction-Tie-Rack-Scarf-Hanger/dp/B000R17YV0/ref=lp_3744561_1_13?s=storageorganization&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1421689530&amp;sr=1-13) for ties. They are obnoxious because the ties hang over each other. Get one (or more) that [mount on the wall](http://www.amazon.com/Closet-Accessories-Scarf-Hanger-colors/dp/B000AEGBU4/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1421688212&amp;sr=8-10&amp;keywords=tie+rack) in a row.

* Life is too short to have ties you don't wear. Ditch them. 

* Same goes for shirts. If you don't feel good when you put them on, throw them out. 

* Tie pins put holes in your ties. Use tie bars instead.

* Cheap black gloves, cheap black scarf, because you'll probably leave them somewhere.

Using a break drum forge, probably not.  Or at least, if you do reach sufficient temperatures, it will only be at the cost of massively inefficient waste of fuel.

A couple other things:

When you talk about ""collecting iron with a strong magnet"", I hope you are talking about random discarded scrap metal.  If you are thinking about finding iron ore, then the vast majority of that is in the form non-magnetic iron oxide.  Also, you may have better luck investing in even a lower end metal detector compared to just trying to use a high power magnet.

You can't just use a regular ceramic crucible.  You need to use a crucible with a lid that you seal up air-tight with clay.  If air gets to your hot iron, it will both burn out the carbon in your steel, and burn the iron into iron oxide and that won't do you any good.  The lid needs to seal on very tightly because ideal gas law means the air that remains in the crucible is going to raise in pressure along with the temperature, and you don't want the lid to pop.

You need to use a combination of scrap iron, crushed glass (cullet) and a blend of other additives depending on what is in the scrap you're starting with to get your desired alloy.  At a minimum, usually at least a little carbon (crushed hardwood charcoal) Other additives may depend on the material used to make your crucible.  You need to gradually heat it up until well past the melting point of iron.  You need to hold it at that temperature long enough for the carbon to distribute through the iron.  You need to allow the crucible to cool at least down to forge-welding temperature.  If you use a lower grade crucible (eg. modified terra cotta flowerpot, which I don't recommend), there's a decent chance you will shatter the thing when extracting your iron/steel.  Also, don't expect your foundry to survive terribly long when you run it at the temperatures needed for crucible steel.

Getting back to how you would heat this crucible,  The cheapest setup would be a [Gingery style backyard charcoal foundry](http://www.amazon.com/Charcoal-Foundry-Build-Metal-Working/dp/1878087002).  It's something like a 7 gallon bucket lined with a few inches of refractory material (It can be made using about $40 worth of stuff from the hardware store), You make a raised mound for the crucible, a tangential hole at the bottom, and a lid with a hole in the center.  You allow it to dry for a few days (more weather depending), then bake slowly using a wood fire to harden.  You put your prepared crucible in place, pack the thing loosely with charcoal all the way to the top, light the charcoal.  Once started, you hook up a leaf blower to the bottom hole and hit it.  Now you get to constantly add more charcoal until the process is complete, and it does burn pretty fast.

Even if you do all this correctly, you can still have failures.  Niels Provos has [a playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4oqKmVgardBn9wCrzAnGBlFSB6fUT5FS) where he attempts to make crucible steel, and only has limited success.",20,t1_cnv7exa,verdatum,0,20,1421782377,t5_2r2f0,0,Blacksmith

So to turn the other cheek is to prevent them from backhanding you again. Humiliating you again. Treating you like an inferior. It's to signal that you refuse to to take shit from the aggressor while showing him that you are occupying a different moral space.


**Edit:** Sorry for going all theology one you, I know it's just a joke but the Catholic in me couldn't help it :/

&gt;""Holy Scripture must be understood in the light of what Christ and the saints have actually practiced.  Christ did not offer His other cheek, nor Paul either.  Thus to interpret the injunction of the Sermon on the Mount literally is to misunderstand it.  This injunction signifies rather the readiness of the soul to bear, if it be necessary, such things and worse, without bitterness against the attacker.  This readiness our Lord showed, when He gave up His body to be crucified.  That response of the Lord was useful, therefore, for our instruction."" (In John 18, lect. 4, 2)

https://www.amazon.com/Boer-War-Thomas-Pakenham/dp/0349104662,,The Boer War,"Germany and the Allies were signers to the Hague Convention of 1907 which outlawed sawtooth bayonets because of the terrible way these weapons killed. Or didn't kill to be more specific. [Here is a pic of one.](http://users.telenet.be/luigike/images/1914_3.JPG)

When the weapon is pulled out all your guts come out with it and you die a very painful death but not for many hours and possibly days later. All the while screaming in agony. There was nothing doctors of the time could do for you. If you're lucky maybe some morphine. 

If you had been stuck with a straight edge bayonet your chances of survival aren't very good but they were better than if you had no more intestines. 

The practice of using saw tooth bayonets started in the Boer Wars. 


The Germans issued these weapons to engineering and pioneer corps and they were not intended to be used as a weapon (Supposedly) but as a tool for cutting wood. They pretty much sucked at cutting wood. I was not aware the allies were issued these weapons.

Here is an exert form [All Quiet On The western Front](http://www.myteacherpages.com/webpages/esimpson/files/AQWF%20-%20full%20text.pdf)

&gt;During the day we loaf about and make war on the rats. Ammunition and hand-grenades
become more plentiful. We overhaul the bayonets--that is to say, the ones that have a saw on the blunt edge. If the fellows over there catch a man with one of those he's killed at sight. In the next
sector some of our men were found whose noses were cut off and their eyes poked out with their
own saw-bayonets. Their mouths and noses were stuffed with sawdust so that they suffocated.
Some of the recruits have bayonets of this sort; we take them away and give them the ordinary
kind. But the bayonet has practically lost its importance. It is usually the fashion now to charge with
bombs and spades only. The sharpened spade is a more handy and many-sided weapon; not only
can it be used for jabbing a man under the chin, but it is much better for striking with because of
its greater weight; and if one hits between the neck and shoulder it easily cleaves as far down as
the chest. The bayonet frequently jams on the thrust and then a man has to kick hard on the
other fellow's belly to pull it out again; and in the interval he may easily get one himself. And
what's more the blade often gets broken off.

Edit: Wow this blew up. My highest rated comment ever and I don't believe I earned it. First I got to say I am by no means an expert. I read a couple books once. For an expert you really should ask this over at /r/askhistory and hope someone replies. /u/civex and /u/rsgort makes a great point about it being mostly perception and used as fuel for the Allied propaganda machine and that makes total sense in hindsight. Let's face it. Neither side felt beholden to the Hague Convention. 

/u/Citizen_Bongo makes a great point about the development of the multi-tool bayonet being developed much earlier than the Boer Wars however I believe it is equally true that due to the nature of the commando style in which the Boers waged war, these types of weapons were much more common in that theater then in others. I'm basing this opinion on [The Boer War](http://www.amazon.com/The-Boer-War-Thomas-Pakenham/dp/0349104662) but I cannot find a soft copy to search or cite my source. I particularly remember a section which went into great detail about some very brutal things both sides did to each other one of which was pulling the intestines out of POWs with these sawtooth bayonets. On purpose! You want to read about brutally, torture, holocaust and just generally fucked up sadistic things humans can do to each other make sure to read up on that war.

There seems to be a [French version](http://www.amazon.com/Enfant-soldat-1-Akira-Fukaya/dp/2756015121/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1421120173&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=akira+fukaya) but no English so far.

I don't have a copy anymore, but IIRC, and if the manga is accurate: Aki Ra was born into the Democratic Kampuchea and his earliest memories are seeing people led to executions. His father was executed for eating a bowl of soup he was not allowed to, and his mother had to clap and smile at his execution or she would be killed. I can't recall how his mother died, but he was basically raised by the Khmer Rouge army with a group of other kids with no parents. It was expected of him that he would become a child soldier, and he was part of the Khmer Rouge army since boyhood, never having gone to school.

Eventually his Khmer Rouge unit was defeated by the North Vietnamese, the adults killed, and the captured child soldiers given the option of joining the North Vietnam-backed Cambodian army (and implied they would be executed if they didn't). So Aki Ra joined the North Vietnamese and fought against the Khmer Rouge for a while, including some of his childhood friends who were still with the Khmer Rouge. During all this time he learned techniques for laying and removing mines, as well as surviving on bushmeat and jungle combat.

Eventually, the cold war ended, peace came and UN peacekeepers started de-mining operations. He joined them as a de-mining expert and started a land mine museum.

It's a fascinating read, because the life of a Cambodian child soldier is so different from what I'm used to.",28,t1_cnn8qd0,0l01o1ol0,0,28,1421122155,t5_2qqjc,0,todayilearned

Raul Hilberg was one of the few. Indeed, many of the people who did speak out about their suffering during the Holocaust were labelled Communist sympathizers, as though the only motive behind their outrage over the incineration of millions of people could be opposition to the U.S. alliance with West Germany (which included many Nazis).

After 1967 it suddenly became a useful propaganda tool to justify America's one-sided support for the strongest military power in the Middle East. Because the Holocaust suddenly became the defining line between ""us"" and ""them,"" these sorts of psychobabble witch-hunts for anyone remotely related to Hitler take place. 

It is truly disgusting what Holocaust survivors have been dragged through. First their entire families were eliminated. Then they were forced to brood in private as others told them that if they mourned in public, they were somehow working for the Soviet Union. Then their suffering became cheap pabulum for Steven Spielberg movies and Israeli propaganda. Then their reparations were stolen.

They're also great for toys, so long as your toy isn't *also* made of silicone. That $150 bad dragon dildo? Not gonna work out. That $20 jelly dick from the sex store down the street? It'll be fine (but I'd still recommend you wrap it up in a condom, the plasticizers used to make gel toys are scary and can off gas for a long time). I've seen some people recommend wrapping silicone toys in condoms, and that makes them safe with silicone lube, but I'd be super cautious about that.

As a side note to /u/travisthemonkey: I really don't know if I *would* recommend silicone lubes for anal sex. A lot of people swear by it, but I'm not personally a fan. Water-based lubes tend to feel more slick and slippery, which is great for the bottom but some tops don't enjoy it as well. Conversely, silicone lubes feel a little more frictiony, so the top may enjoy it more but the bottom won't.

In *any* case, I really don't recommend Astroglide for anal sex. I find it to be a bit too runny and it doesn't really work out too well if it doesn't stay where you put it. I prefer a product called [J-Lube](http://www.amazon.com/Jorvet-J0109-J-Lube-Obstetrics-10-Ounce/dp/B006G2S17A), which seems odd but it's been used for years.

It sounds dumb, but having a plant at your desk or workstation can significantly improve your mood and happiness. Are you breathing in all that nasty-ass recirculated, stale air? Plants can help with that. There are even plants that are specifically suggested for improving air quality (aloe plants, for example). 

It's also so gratifying. Start with a tiny pothos sprout (looks kind of like ivy) or spider plant clipping. Give that a few months and BOOM, it's taking over half your office. You did that! You made that little guy grow up into the big, strong, leafy thing he is today! 

Don't know what you're doing? Do ten minutes of research on the internet and give it a shot. You can get plenty of plants for free or cheap. I'll bet someone in your office already has a plant they can make you a clipping of and give you suggestions on how to raise it. Plant dies? That's okay. Just try again. 

No windows? No problem. Lots of plants do well on minimal or artificial light. Pothos is a creeping vine that doesn't need much sun. Peace lilies are big dark green plants with white flowers that are pretty easy to take care of.

Out of town a lot and can't water it frequently? Get a succulent! Most cacti are succulents, as is aloe. They need very little care. 

Plants, man. Plants will improve the quality of your deskspace by leaps and bounds. 

EDIT: A lot of people have been asking for recommendations for a plant. I don't know everything there is to know about plants, but I can give a few suggestions:

**First thing's first: before you bring any plant into your house, check to see whether it's toxic to your pets or humans. Poinsettias typically aren't allowed at nursing homes because they're toxic to humans and sometimes people with dementia will try to eat them. A LOT of plants are toxic to dogs and cats. Make sure the plant you get won't kill the ones you love!**

(Note that plants that are toxic to humans are still okay in most offices since most people don't just go around eating plants)

**What's a good plant for my desk that gets no light?**

For no/low light areas (north-facing windows, offices with no windows, etc), some good bets are: 

* Pothos: A very low maintenance vine that will grow without much help. Pothos actually don't like direct sunlight, so low-light areas are great for it. Note: Pothos is toxic to cats, dogs, and I think children. 

* [Sansevieria](http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/sansevieria-a-favorite-housepl-89610), aka Mother In Law's Tongue or Snake's Tongue: This requires minimal water and light, so it's good for someone who isn't around often. Sansevieria is especially good for cleaning the air as well, so it's nice to put in an office or bedroom or wherever you breathe for several hours a day. Mildly toxic to cats and dogs. 

**Where can I buy plants?**

You can buy plants online -- you can even get Pothos [for under $10 on Amazon!](http://www.amazon.com/Hirts-Golden-Devils-Ivy-Epipremnum/dp/B0076ZJ21K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1421267821&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=pothos) -- but I've only ever bought seeds online. For live plants, a nursery is a good option if you can find one in your area. Stores like Home Depot, Lowes, Walmart, and other big stores usually have a nursery. I actually really like the plants I've gotten from Home Depot. Smaller, dedicated nurseries are also really good places to go if you know you want a plant but don't know much else. People there can help you find something that fits what you need. 

Honestly though, most of my plants I got for free. It was strange: the first plant I ever brought into my office was a peace lily. A week or so later, a coworker dropped by and asked if I wanted a cutting from his spider plant. After that the floodgates opened. People just started bringing me plants that they had extras of or didn't want any more or didn't know how to take care of. I probably have twenty or thirty plants in my office, including an enormous jade plant that lives in a garbage can because it got too big for everything else, and the only one I bought was the peace lily. Talk to coworkers with plants. They'll probably give you a trimming to start your own if you ask.

Basically, good coffee needs only a couple things and one of them is freshly ground and freshly roasted beans.  It doesn't matter what coffee you brew if you didn't grind it freshly it won't be as good.  The Mini Mill is also pretty affordable so you could pair that with a bag of freshly roasted coffee.  If you don't mind buying things offline (ie, in the real world), then I would try and find a local roaster that you can drive to.  Odds are if you're in/near a city you have one but may not know you do.  You mentioned a particular place, they sound like a re-seller but likely they do get very fresh shipments (perhaps once a week since this is how my local shops work).  If you would prefer to buy it online, then I can suggest Klatch Coffee Roasters in CA and Verve Coffee (also in CA).  The former charges for shipping, but it's $5-$6 via USPS.  The latter does *not*, which is fantastic if you're interested in ordering one bag of coffee.  I wouldn't pay $5-$6 to ship one bag of coffee, but I would to ship two bags.

The important thing to remember with coffee beans is that you want it fresh.  Ideally a couple days after being roasted, if not sooner, so you should be looking to buy this a few days before Valentine's.",16,t1_cns4yl7,tangerinelion,0,16,1421523379,t5_2qhze,0,Coffee

and then makes this comment.



&gt;The theory of NP-completeness provides many straightforward techniques for proving that a given problem is just as hard as a large number of other problems that are widely recognize as being difficult and that have been confounding the experts for years. Armed with these techniques, you might be able to prove that the bandersnatch problem is NP-complete and march into your boss's office and announce: I can't find an efficient algorithm, but neither can all these famous people.

&gt;--

&gt;I guess I make a distinction between reducing problem to another known NP-complete problem and proving a problem is NP-complete. Apparently we can't prove anything is NP-complete, we can only throw a wall of experts at it and see them all fail.

&gt;**So, a NP-complete problem is not mathematically proven, it's one that no experts can solve, eg, I'll know it when I see it.**

&gt;Or more specifically we'll know it when lots of experts have seen it, tried, and failed.

&gt;Is this wrong?

this guy is a joke. 

there are a few more gems if you bother to look around there too.

https://www.amazon.com/Deal-Difficult-People-Rick-Brinkman/dp/0943066433,,How to Deal with Difficult People,"Ah. I can relate to this. It's really difficult, and it's why I prefer to work from home and deal with people as little as possible.

For me, it's really helped to try and observe them and understand what really lies beneath what they're saying. For instance, a lot of people who ar actually really insecure tend to go for passive agressiveness, or they feel hurt/annoyed, and want to ""punish"" the other person instead of clearing up the misunderstsanding and explaining their feelings. It's also helped me a lot to identify precisely what kind of passive aggresiveness and logical fallacies they are using. I'd recommend [this list over logical fallacies](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com) and [this list over common passive aggressive behaviour](http://www.bandbacktogether.com/psychological-manipulation-resources/). I find it really helpful to at least be able to identify what exactly is going on. When I was little, I'd be so dazzled and confused and frustrated by my mother's way of dealing with things – I knew that something wasn't right, but I couldn't put my finger on it, both because I was too hurt and frustrated, and because I just didn't know that people could be so... Illogical. /Data

It's important to be aware of the fact that they probably don't even *know* how to handle their feelings in a better way, probably because they learned this from their parents. This doesn't mean that they *should* act this way or that it's justified, but it really helps me to just understand them better and understand that it's a sort of defense mechanism for them, rather than them being ""evil"" or actually wanting to hurt me.

I recommend that you make a well-thought-out analysis of whether it's worth it to calmly point out their logical fallacies – by which I mean not saying ""your logical fallacy is x"", but rather explaining how you don't think what they're saying makes sense. In a work environment, this can bite you in the ass, especially if managers are treating you this way. If not: Have you tried talking to HR/your boss about this? 

Oh, I just remembered something: Maybe [this book](http://www.amazon.com/How-Deal-With-Difficult-People/dp/0943066433) could be of any help?

My dad nearly ran me over in his Bronco when I was twelve (we had just gotten home from camping -he was tired &amp; forgotten that he had asked me to untie the kayak where we had secured it under the front bumper).  He got in the SUV to move it from the yard to the garage - if I hadn't yelled (not enough time to move out of the way) &amp; he hadn't heard me then I could have been really hurt.  My dad felt bad about it for weeks &amp; kept apologizing to me, even though nothing happened.

When my daughter was two my ex and I were visiting some friends.  They heated their house with a wood stove that was surrounded by this accordion gate thing ([like this](http://www.amazon.com/Northstate-Superyard-Playgate-Light-Gray/dp/B00004RA66)).  They didn't have any children, the gate was meant to keep their puppy away.  My daughter got behind the gate &amp; our friends mom saw her and snatched her away just as she was reaching for the stove.  Just in time, but not quick enough - my daughter got a small burn on her hand.  I took her to the doctor because I was terrified of it being a second or third degree burn (I was twenty &amp; a very anxious first-time parent).  The pediatrician gave me a pat on the back and instructions to just put neosporin and a bandaid on it.  I still felt crushing guilt for weeks any time I saw that pink shiny mark on her little hand.

Secure the shelf &amp; anything else the little mountain climber might have eyes on.  Hold your little girl and be profoundly grateful for what you have.  Kiss your wife and appreciate the she-warrior that snatched your daughter from harm.  Remember - all of you are okay.  You just got a very scary glimpse into another reality where you aren't.

A SGFC is essentially any storage tub with 1/4-1/8 inch holes drilled every 2 inches on all sides (top bottom left right front and back) and 4 inches of gardening perlite, soaked in water and laid in the container. 

This allows for Fresh Air Exchange (FAE) while still retaining high levels of humidity...although, you have to fan/mist the SGFC types...which is why I prefer my first method.

https://www.amazon.com/Generations-History-Americas-Future-1584/dp/0688119123,,"Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069","ah, ""ye ol' america sucks"" argument

a popular form of entertainment around this snowy time of year as we gather around the fireplace drinking cocoa with peppermint... 

to recount wondrous yet bone-chilling tales of the slender man of damnable wallstreet, the ghost of guts in generations past and of course those lazy, fat, incorrigible americans... luckily the third little piggie builds a house out of bricks

I wonder how much the appropriately named /u/gloomdoom actually knows about generational cycles?

very detailed information from [generations book on amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Generations-History-Americas-Future-1584/dp/0688119123/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1422276334&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=generations+strauss)  

that is....... a cycle of 4

* gen x:  pragmatic introvert
* gen y (millennials):  pragmatic extrovert 
* gen z (born 2005-2025):  idealistic introvert
* gen a (not born):  idealistic extrovert  

the extroverted generations are the generations that get shit done.... the introverted generations are more of a regroup from the failures (pragmatic vs idealistic) of the previous generation... it takes time to turn the social ship around so to speak.  

now some people don't like gen theory because they think it's woo woo-- but it's likely based in psychology/sociology-- that this action and style of generation has a predictable social reaction.

also the cycle was broken during the civil war into a generational cycle of 3 rather than 4 because of that event-- so it's not like the social pattern can't be disrupted by events either. 

the upshot is-- millennials-- yours is a generation of successfully getting shit done...... so don't be so gloomy.... you have a great pragmatic base already established (from gen x) so you are mentally prepared to tackle massive structural challenges.  

not every generation is so lucky        ",11,t1_co17czg,velatine,0,11,1422276958,t5_2qh3v,0,bestof

https://www.amazon.com/Every-Third-Woman-America-Transformed/dp/0990833607,,Every Third Woman in America: How Legal Abortion Transformed Our Nation,"I am not a fan of this man, Dr. David A. Grimes, because he links to crap. (Sorry. I do not how to say that more politely.)  Let me share some examples.

First link I clicked on was:
&gt;Before Roe v. Wade in 1973, an estimated *200,000 to 1.2 million* illegal abortions occurred annually in the U.S. 

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5524615


I followed that link and found that:
&gt;To be eligible to use PubMed Commons, you must be an author of a publication in PubMed. You will need an invitation to join PubMed Commons and an NCBI account. This is free of charge.

Happy day!  (Sorry. I find restriction of information that is in a public comment disingenuous at the best of times.)

Then I looked again at the article I was to read about the national rate of abortion and found the title was:
&gt;Estimates of induced abortion in urban North Carolina.

which, leaving out that it was only urban abortion, was only from NC.  

I  click on other links. He quotes the Institute of Medicine from a 1975 paper:
&gt;...the Institute of Medicine had concluded that legal abortion improved the health of women.


although the summary, which is all I read, says they ""should enable and encourage women who have chosen abortion  to obtain it during the first three months of pregnancy.""

I know that many would not be pleased to hear that conclusion. Why is he quoting an article form 1975 as the final word anyway? Who has time to read through a 177-page *scanned* document anyway?

http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=18521&amp;page=8

So I went to a third link from this statement:
&gt; All major medical and public health organizations today affirm the health benefits of legal abortion; these include ...

Hey! Isn't that a link so I can buy his book? 

http://www.amazon.com/Every-Third-Woman-America-Transformed/dp/0990833607/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1421280844&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=grimes+and+brandon

Yup! it is.

There's a really great book I've been reading that's been mentioned a lot, here and in other subs like /r/relationships, called


**""Why does he do that?"" by Lundy Bancroft.**

Bancroft is a counsellor who has worked with abusive men to change their behaviours. In the book, he outlines a lot of tactics that abusers use, which are (surprise, surprise) pretty much the same tactics TRPers talk about to win over women. 

He also mentions tips that women can use to identify/avoid potential abusers. (I'll see if I can find that section and post it here)

It's a worthwhile read - you should definitely check it out!


Edit: (Some Key Points from Bancroft's ""Why Does He Do That"" - How Can I Tell if a Man I'm Seeing Will Become Abusive?)

* **He speaks disrespectfully about his former partners**: Be cautious if he is very focused on his bitterness or tells you about his exes early on in your dating. Also, be aware if he says you are nothing like the women he's been involved with - it could be a tactic to get you to work doubly hard to prove you're not like the women he was with.
 
* **He is disrespectful towards you**:  Put downs, sneering at your opinions, rudeness towards you in front of other people communicates lack of respect. Also, if he idealizes you, puts you on a pedestal, treats you like a fine piece of china, this is also something to watch out for. He could turn nasty if you don't live up to his perfect image

* **He does favors for you that you don't want or puts on such a show of generosity that it makes you uncomfortable**: This may be a sign of someone who is trying to create a sense of indebtedness

* **He is controlling**: This usually starts off gradually, with subtle hints about your clothes or looks, or negative remarks about family or friends. Eventually, he may start to show hints of impatience that you don't share the same opinions.

* **He is possessive**: Possessiveness shows he doesn't love you as an independent human being but rather as a guarded treasure

* **Nothing is ever his fault**: As time goes by, the target of blame increasingly becomes you.

* **He is self-centered**: Notice when he does a lot more than his share of talking, listens poorly when you speak, shifts the topic of conversation to himself

* **He abuses drugs or alcohol**: Bancroft says that chances are, even without a drug/alcohol addiction, the abuser will always remain an abuser, and will blame his behaviours on the drugs/alcohol. However, be careful if he pressures you to take drugs/alcohol with him.

* **He pressures you for sex**

* **He gets serious too quickly about the relationship**

* **He intimidates you when he's angry**

* **He has double standards**

* **He has negative attitudes towards women**

* **He treats you differently around other people**

* **He appears to be attracted to vulnerability**

 
Edit #2: Gilded? *Me?* **Gilded?** Oh, wow! I'm all of a dither

That's why a lot of the early union organizers and socialists/communists sought racial equality. For instance, in Grand Rapids' factories the Germans were paid the most, followed by the Dutch, and then the Polish.^1  People of color were lucky to have a factory job. You can read about how different groups like the IWW had to overcome language barriers to help form unions, and how the racial separations made it more difficult to organize. The higher paid races were less sympathetic to the lower paid ones and feared organizing would mean they'd get paid less to compensate for the lower wages getting raised.

You use [Limelight](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.limelight)  (or [Limelight for Root](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.limelight.root) if you're rooted to enable 1:1 mouse movement if you use M&amp;K), which is an open source re-implementation of gamestreaming (still requires NVidia GPU for hardware reasons).  Connect to it once on the same network, type in the verification code to pair the device to your PC, and you're good to go on the PC end.

To get the DS4 (or DS3!) to work, you use [Sixaxis Controller] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dancingpixelstudios.sixaxiscontroller) (note:  doesn't work with stock HTC and some Samsung devices due to bluetooth stack issues, you'll need GPE or an AOSP-based ROM on those).  You can even use the touchpad as a direct touchscreen or as a mouse like on PC.  You can configure the keybindings for the controller quite easily and even set up touch emulation profiles for games that don't natively support gamepads.  

Limelight picks up on the DS4 without any configuration necessary, it essentially sees it as an Xbox gamepad now and so will your PC.  Top it all off with a [Nyko Smart Klip](http://www.amazon.com/Nyko-Smart-Clip-PlayStation-4/dp/B00FLLFGO8) or an OTG cable, USB hub, USB mouse and keyboard (bluetooth keyboard is really unreliable with Limelight last I tried and I've heard others have similar results, gamepad and mouse work fine) and you've got a hyper portable console crusher.

Depending on the connection, it can work really well.  I have a high end GPU and a very fast home internet connection, and I normally play on mobile data with T-mobile.  As long as I have a good signal, it works almost laglessly.  I was getting about ~75ms latency in Puerto Rico with my PC in Nevada, and I wasn't even getting LTE there.  Could only run 720p30fps, but still, worked great.  However, when I was in Texas, where the entire state is flat and they have probably a single tower covering the whole state because there's nothing to stop the signal, I was getting ~300ms.

You'll need a steady &gt;5mbps for 720p30fps, &gt;10mbps for 1080p30fps/720p60fps, and about &gt;20mbps for 1080p60fps on both your home upload and client download.",11,t1_cnoj1kw,LordSocky,0,11,1421225251,t5_2sgp1,0,pcmasterrace

Some people see motherhood as the only way they can contribute to society or feel important and respected.

I think American society makes 3 huge mistakes that lead to this. We glorify motherhood, we keep the myth of the American dream on life support, and we don't talk enough about the cost of having children. Too many people think that they will birth the child that will go on to cure cancer or strike oil when the rule is that children born into poverty usually stay impoverished and they keep their parents impoverished.

People usually overstate the incidence of unintended pregnancy among the poor, which is less than 15%. I imagine that the slightly higher rate of unintended pregnancy among the poor is mostly due to not being able to afford birth control.",22,t1_cnoq9tu,saikron,0,22,1421249944,t5_2qtwb,0,childfree

Children that age are simply not capable of realizing how many small problems contribute to the overall complexity of a problem.  In order to effectively teach kids problem solving or robotics, it is essential to artificially reduce the complexity of the little problems.  For example on our outside robot we have the following very non-trivial problems that are not strictly related to the central problem of, find interesting stuff then investigate:

1. dirt getting in our robot and clogging it.  building stuff that works well outdoors is hard.
2. sensing different types of soil or surface.  this is an enormously complex and expensive thing to do
3. digging, moving dirt with a little robot is very hard.  the complexity of that is crazy.
4. cost, as a robotics engineering student in college, It would probably cost more than 1000 dollars to have a really good robot to do what you want.
5. time, kids get bored fast.  this kind of problem would likely take an engineer a couple days at least.  kids don't focus for that long.

if you wanted to come up with a different challenge that would be easier to succeed and teach with, I would go with something like the following:  Cut out a bunch of pieces of construction paper, maybe 1.5 inch diameter circles.  mostly brown or grey or black but a few red ones.  Stick all these pieces of paper on a table in a random mess, you can even cut up the paper to look like leaves or something, and the red ones to look like ladybugs, whatever works to make the mock up yard feel more real.  The idea is to build an environment that is similar to outside, but has much less ""hidden"" complexity to overcome.  Now build a robot that drives around and has a little arm with some tape on it that it can push down on the table to pick up paper with, this way our robot doesn't have to actually dig or grasp objects, which eliminates some of the difficulty of the challenge.  This robot could use a simple color sensor, which comes with every Lego NXT kit now to sense the leaf color.  This eliminates most of the complexity of our sensor.  By using legos we have an easier platform to work with.  its not longer difficult for the kid to focus for long periods of time because it can come together faster, and its more toy like.  we also have a relatively low cost option, a 400$ lego kit is an amazing deal considering it can be re-configured.

here are some links to robotics kits that you might like.  I highly recommend lego for a kid this age, but there are some other options if you'd prefer a toy you can learn something from as well.

However, after just going through my first build, I will give you a list of extra little things that you will probably need but haven't thought of yet because this is your first build. It's annoying to get all of your parts in just to realize that you're missing some battery connectors or you don't have a tiny hex screwdriver for some screws on your frame. You will probably need the following:

* **Battery charger**: you need a charger meant for LiPo batteries. A lot of people recommend the [Turnigy Accucel-6](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__7028__Turnigy_Accucel_6_50W_6A_Balancer_Charger_w_Accessories.html) (it's what I've got). Note that this guy doesn't come with the AC adapter that plugs into your wall. Any simple 12V power supply will work. I use a 12V/1.5A adapter I found in a box that used to go to an old router, but you can power it with other things like a 12V lead acid battery or an old computer power supply.
* **LiPo Charging Bag**: I mean something like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Bluecell-Medium-Battery-Sleeve-Storage/dp/B005Q3VSZC). LiPos are known to ignite if over- or under-charged. I use one of these to charge and store my LiPos. I've heard of other people using things like old ammo boxes for storage. LiPos are fine when properly handled, but a simple LiPo bag could save your house if your charger malfunctions.
* **Soldering iron**: building a quad normally requires lots of soldering. You'll need one if you don't already have one. Most people recommend your soldering iron is at least 40W (the higher the wattage, the more heat it can produce). But I cheaped out with [this 25W kit](http://www.amazon.com/Elenco-Electronics-St-12-Soldering-New/dp/B00KQFUMD4), and I haven't had any problems. If you don't get a kit, I would recommend getting some solder wick or a solder sucker so you can remove the solder if you mess up.
* **Extra solder**: it sucks to run out of solder in the middle of your build. You can pick up a couple of spools of 60/40 rosin core solder at RadioShack, and it will work just fine.
* **Helping hands**: [this thing](http://www.harborfreight.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/i/m/image_18418.jpg) is great for holding things together while you try to solder them.
* **Electronics screwdriver kit**: you'll need a tiny screwdriver for screwing most things in your build. Not every screw is Phillips-head though, so get a kit that includes different sizes of hex and star bits too.
* **Wire cutter/stripper**: you will need this.
* **Multimeter**: you could get away without one of these, but they can give some peace of mind to know that you're not short-circuiting anything before you connect your battery and fry your flight controller.
* **PDB**: a [power distribution board](http://abusemark.com/store/images/afropower_mini.jpg). This little thingy has solder pads all around it. The + pads are all connected together, and the – pads are all connected together. So you can wire your battery terminals to one + pad and one – pad, and all the other + pads will be 12V power and all the other – pads will be ground. These are useful for distributing 12V power to everything in your quad that needs it: each ESC, FPV camera, video Tx, voltage monitor on your FC, etc. The alternative to a PDB is a [wiring harness](http://oddcopter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Wiring-Harness.jpg), but I think those are kinda messy. That PDB link shows a 36mm PDB, the perfect size for the ZMR250 frame. (Side-note: the Crius FC you have in your list is 50mm x 50mm and is probably too big for the ZMR250 frame. I would recommend a 36mm FC like the Naze32).
* **18 gauge wire**: it doesn't have to be 18 gauge, but that's a good medium size for most use cases on a quad. Use this for wiring a battery connector to your PDB among lots of other uses. Get both red and black.
* **XT-60 connectors**: [these things](http://mikrokopter.altigator.com/images/wires_and_connectors/xt-60-connectors.jpg). It's the same connector that is on the battery you listed. I would get a pack of both male and female connectors. You'll need one wired to your PDB to get power from your battery to your quad. I've also used these guys to power my FPV Rx and monitor with a separate battery.
* **3.5mm bullet connectors**: [these things](http://img.diytrade.com/cdimg/910292/8806300/0/1240555555/Gold_Plated_Bullet_Connectors_RC_connector.jpg) can be soldered on to connect your motor leads to your ESCs. Some people prefer to solder their motors directly to their ESCs, but I like the bullet connector option in case you need to swap out a defective motor.
* **Servo cables**: depending on which FC and Rx you get, they may or may not come with [servo cables](http://www.myrcmart.com/images/upload/RCX03-342-Servo-Cable-JR-Female-To-Female-10CM-01.jpg). It might be a good idea to have 10 or so of these laying around. These things are used to connect your Rx to your flight controller, among other things.
* **5V buzzer**: you might want a little 5V piezo buzzer connected to your FC to notify you of low battery voltage or to turn on with a switch on your Tx if you can't find your quad in high grass or something.
* **Micro USB cable**: a lot of flight controllers (like the Naze32 or the Crius) use a [micro USB cable](http://mrgadgetrepair.com/communities/4/004/012/476/794/images/4606334248.jpg) to connect to your computer for configuration. However, you are almost guaranteed that they won't come with one. You might already have one from an old cell phone charger, or you can pick one up at any electronics store. Notice that this is a *micro* USB and not a *mini* USB. Make sure you get the correct one, since a mini USB won't fit in the receptacle.
* **Zip ties**: get lots of them. Tie down your ESCs to the arms of your frame... tuck away wires so they don't get chopped up by your props... these things are used everywhere. I prefer black so they blend in with your black frame.
* **Velcro**: get some longs strips of adhesive-backed velcro. It's great for securing things to your quad that you take off often like your battery or your Mobius camera.
* **Velcro battery strap**: get some of [these things](http://onetencrawlers.com.au/images/axic0041.jpg) for even more secure attachments of batteries and things.
* **Heat shrink**: used for insulating soldered connections. Get lots of this in a few different sizes.
* **M3 sized screws, nuts, and standoffs**: something like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Male-female-Spacers-Stand-off-Plastic-Assortment/dp/B00NJJI2FO) is useful for securing your PDB and FC to your frame. I would get a nylon set, since nylon screws are a lot lighter than metal screws.  Most of the holes on the ZMR250 frame are size M3, *except* for the motor holes. Those are M2, so you might want to get some M2 screws also just in case.

Amazon description of the book:

Feelings of oneness with other people, nature, and the universe. Encounters with extraterrestrials, deities, and demons. Out-of-body experiences and past-life memories. Science casts a skeptical eye. But Dr. Stanislav Grof—the psychiatric researcher who cofounded transpersonal psychology—believes otherwise.
When the Impossible Happens presents Dr. Grof 's mesmerizing firsthand account of over 50 years of inquiry into waters uncharted by classical psychology, one that will leave readers questioning the very fabric of our existence.
From his first LSD session that gave him a glimpse of cosmic consciousness to his latest work with Holotropic Breathwork, When the Impossible Happens will amaze readers with vivid explorations of topics such as:

·       Temptations of a Non-Local Universe—experiments in astral projection

·       Praying Mantis in Manhattan and other tales of synchronicity

·       Trailing Clouds of Glory—remembering birth and prenatal life

·       Dying and Beyond—survival of consciousness after death

When the Impossible Happens is an incredible opportunity to journey beyond ordinary consciousness, guaranteed to shake the foundations of what we assume to be reality, and sure to offer a new vision of our human potential.",15,t1_cnlyvhi,juloxx,0,15,1421021162,t5_2tcwa,0,Glitch_in_the_Matrix

https://www.amazon.com/Remote-Viewing-Complete-Manual-Coordinate/dp/1604074361,,Remote Viewing: The Complete User's Manual for Coordinate Remote Viewing,"So here are my thoughts in response to yours.  This is just my 2 cents and you can take it or leave it.  Have you ever tried to have your own experience?  You mentioned that you read stories, watch videos, visit websites, and look at pictures to try and find evidence of the paranormal.  This is all fine and good, but these are other people's experiences.  I guess you would have to ask yourself, at what point would you accept someone else's experience as truth or proof of the paranormal?

When we analyze, ponder, or humor the experiences of others in these areas the scrutiny is high.  There is almost always room for doubt.  Take [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tb8bWbA678) for example.  In it, a Qi Gong master demonstrates some amazing abilities that he attributes to 'Chi' or life force.  These scientists can only measure what they know, and what is physical.  At one point one of the scientists says ""As a scientist I can't measure 'Chi'.  It's not measurable.  It is not anything that I can quantify.""  Think about this problem.  How can science prove the paranormal when it cannot even measure or quantify it?  The scientific method has it's limits.  When it comes to the paranormal you can only indirectly measure.  You can observe influences, but you cannot directly measure the force or power behind the influence, if that makes sense...

There are ways of having a safe and personal first-hand experience with something paranormal.  If you've read my posts on here before I like to reference Controlled Remote Viewing (CRV) and Past Life Regressions (PLRs).  The [International Remote Viewing Association](http://www.irva.org/library/articles/) website has tons of peer reviewed scientific articles and papers on the subject of Remote Viewing.  What better way demonstrate that consciousness is non-local?  The cool thing is that you can learn Remote Viewing for yourself if you are willing to commit the time.  Money isn't really an issue since there are [free courses on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=448487A4D794A489) and [cheap books on Amazon to teach it](http://www.amazon.com/Remote-Viewing-Complete-Manual-Coordinate/dp/1604074361).  I have some bad news for you though.  Remote Viewing has been public knowledge since it was declassified back in 1995 and the world still has not woken up or changed.  It doesn't have to stay that way though.  The trick is to not worry about what others think or believe.  Work on what YOU think and believe and you can change the world, one mind at a time.  People still say Remote Viewing is fake or a scam or cold war propaganda.  They can believe whatever helps them sleep at night.  Meanwhile I am learning how to do it and am having success.  It is harder than it looks, so it will take time and dedication, but you should have enough success with your first real attempt that it will show you something is truly possible with it.  

Past Life Regressions are the same way.  You can [find a hypnotherapist](http://newtoninstitute.org/locate-a-therapist/) trained and certified to perform a regression session in your area and have your own experience if you so desire.  They will usually have an audio recorder or let you bring your own so you can keep the whole experience for playback later.  I found myself wondering and doubting on the subject after reading some books on PLRs.  There was no substitute for having my own personal experience so I would know what it was like to sit in the chair and have that vivid experience.  Is it all fantasy or is it a meaningful memory that truly fits you and your personal circumstances in life?  You can decide for yourself, but not until you go through with it and have the experience.  Otherwise it is just an academic exercise.

Skepticism is healthy so don't lose that.  Always ask questions and do your own thinking.  Skepticism is only healthy until the point where you close your mind to new information.  At that point even the truth cannot get in.  Some people are so open minded that they will believe anything.  You need to find balance between the two, and it can be difficult at times.  Stay the course, and stay thirsty for not just knowledge but experience.  It is by far the best teacher!  :)  Thanks for reading.",22,t1_cnzn9nc,SecretAgentMan_007,0,22,1422134696,t5_2qjxn,0,Paranormal

__________

When we focus on the reward or the product of the task that we need to perform, it doesn't really address the real reason that we're procrastinating, and can release stress related chemicals making us even less motivated.

**Why we procrastinate:  When we think of something we have to do that's unpleasant or uncomfortable, it literally triggers neural discomfort in the part of our brain associated with pain: the *insular cortex*.**  Focusing on the reward or the product/outcome of the task can amplify this neural discomfort because the task has yet to be performed.

**So what happens when we procrastinate?**  We first think of the thing that we don't want to do.  Our insular cortex receives that discomfort/pain message and our brain immediately switches our attention and thoughts to something else that's pleasant, temporarily relieving that discomfort and triggering a cue for us to do something else.  We're distracted and procrastinating now.  This only temporarily eases the discomfort of that neural response.  

**The good news:**  It's absolutely normal to feel negative or uncomfortable thoughts when starting *anything.*  Research shows that when we engage in the activity for a couple of minutes, the neural response in the insular cortex eases and we don't feel as much discomfort.  In other words, the more we engage in the task we're putting off, the better we'll feel about doing it.

__________

Movation in our brain

**Neuromodulators:**  These are chemicals that influence how neurons respond to other neurons and whether or not we get out of bed in the morning.  Those chemicals?

**acetylcholine:**  This chemical controls focused learning and attention.  Supplements exist.

**dopamine:**  This is THE rewards chemical and the most important chemical for motivation; release it and you feel good.  Too much, and life sucks over time (stay away from bad drugs).  Lose dopamine and you have no motivation.  Like, if you literally have no dopamine you go catatonic.  No joke.  Learn to do things that release this chemical naturally and you're good.

**serotonin:**  This is the chemical that controls your social life and risk-taking behavior.   Prozac increases this chemical in the brain.  Low serotonin levels means high-risk behavior.  The most violent criminals in our prisons have the lowest serotonin levels.  Keep that chemical in check.

__________

Four things to understand about our habits:

**A Cue:**  This is an event that welcomes our engagement or participation.  Phone, porn, food, thoughts; you get the idea.  Cues are neither helpful nor harmful.

**A Routine:**  This is the mindless activity that we engage in after having received the cue.  Routines can be useful, harmless, or harmful.

**A reward:**  Habits develop or continue because they give us pleasant feelings.  Procrastination is one of them because it makes us feel good, **temporarily.**  In this way, procrastination is like an addiction.  We do it for the temporary good feelings.  Immediate reward.  We can, however, rewire to become ""addicted"" to new habits by rewarding ourselves for new routines.

**A Belief:**  Habits have power because of our belief in them.  To change a habit we must change the underlying belief.  

__________

Spread out your tasks and your rewards for improved productivity and better motivation.

Our brains have a lot to do.  Focusing too long on something is like doing too much exercise.  Our brains need breaks from the tasks that we're performing.  By breaking our productivity into smaller chunks and taking a break with a reward (remember, we need the reward fairly soon because procrastination gives us the dopamine feel-good chemical now) we'll find it's much easier to be better motivated.  The reward can be internet time, tv, book, walk, coffee, etc.  I've found that anything I'm doing while I procrastinate can often be used as the reward during breaks.  

**Pomodoro (google it):**  Set a timer for 25:00.  Turn off interruptions.  Focus on your task.  Take a break with a reward and let your brain relax for a bit.  **Hint:**  You're releasing dopamine with the reward and training your brain to crave the new behavior.    

__________

Changing our procrastination habits

**Cues - If we change our reaction to these (see above) we win.**  Turn off the stuff that distracts you and gently ignore any new distractions while you're focused on your task.  

**Routine - Rewire here by developing a plan or new ritual to react to the cue.**  By engaging in new reactions and new routines, and rewarding ourselves immediately after, we'll begin to crave habits that are more productive.  I've already been doing this with success more or less, but this information helps me to understand why it works.  Perform tasks in smaller chunks.  Spread those chunks out to make the project more manageable.  Set your timer for 25:00, or shorter, or longer (not very much) and take a break - five minutes minimum but go longer if the task is super taxing.

**Reward - Super important!  Reward yourself with something to indulge in immediately after your task**  Doesn't have to be food or cost money.  It's your time and your indulgence.  Remember:  One of the reasons that procrastination is one of our default habits is because we're rewarded immediately for it.  We're training our brains to crave a better feel-good response, one that's not too distant in the future, and one that helps us change our habit.  No reward = we won't feel good about changing our habit.

**Belief - Change the underlying belief about the task you're going to perform.**  Don't tell yourself elaborate stories about how hard it will be or how long it will take.  Focus on the process (flow of time, and the habits and actions associated with that time), and not the outcome, product, or completion.  Understand that for the larger stuff you'll only be focused in small increments of time, and only on the task at hand. (**Hard lesson:**  Our environment, our friends, our family, and our level of understanding and knowing our place in the cosmos will directly effect whether or not we'll ever believe that anything is worth doing in life, even in small increments of time.  By broadening these things or changing them completely, we'll find it much easier to change our attitudes, behaviors, and habits.)

__________

**It's normal to feel negative or uncomfortable thoughts when starting *anything*.**  Engage in the activity for a couple of minutes and those feelings will go away.  Because research and science.

**Don't judge yourself:**  Allow your mind to relax into a flow of the work or activity you're going to engage in.  Everybody sucks at stuff in the beginning.  Life's messy and so is the stuff we have to do to get things done.  Take breaks and vacations.  Research shows that people who balance fun time with work time outperform workaholics over and over and over.

**When distractions or new cues present themselves,** let them go; gently ignore them and relax back into the process and flow of the activity.

**""I'm different and special and I'm a genius and none of this applies to me.""**  No you're not and yes it does.  Look, some of us may have more astrocytes than others (look that up) so we have some talent.  But without a plan to do something with those astrocytes, we're going to be stuck with the same addiction to procrastination.

**Not all procrastination is bad.**  Sometimes our brain really does need a break, so take one.  Sometimes we're spending too much time on a large task and need to break it up into smaller tasks.  Smaller tasks makes it more manageable and taking breaks helps our brains relax.  Less stress, more dopamine, healthy brain.  Balanced leisure time with productivity time makes us more productive.  Because research and science.

**Write down the things you want to accomplish the night before.**  This frees up energy in your prefrontal cortex and makes it easier for you to get started.  Again, because science.  While you sleep your brain processes that stuff and you're more likely to actually do them.

**Keep a planner journal** to outline what works and what doesn't as pertains to changing your procrastination responses and routines.

**No rewards until you've finished the immediate task/pomodoro.**

**Keep an eye on procrastination cues.**

**Gain trust in your new system.**

**Have backup plans for when you still procrastinate.**

**Be bad at it for awhile.**  

**tl;dr:**  When we procrastinate, it's because thinking of doing something unpleasant can trigger discomfort in the part of our brain associated with pain.  Focusing on the reward or the product/outcome of the task can amplify this same discomfort, because the unpleasant task has yet to be done.  Our brain switches to more pleasant thoughts to release dopamine (feel-good chemical), but this only temporarily feels good.  In this, procrastination shares common features with addiction.  We can tackle procrastination by focusing on the process of the task (the flow of time, and the habits and actions associated with that time), and taking breaks with small rewards.",157,t1_co2ohif,BigSquirrelSmallTree,0,157,1422388495,t5_2s5oq,0,LifeProTips

That was a time when the internet was still just for military, defense contractors, and major computer science and engineering universities. There were around 1000 computers on the internet then. The opening up of the internet for civilians, starting with the creation of NSFNet by the National Science Foundation, wasn't to start until 1985, and it wasn't until 1992 that the web was invented.

So when he was a cable guy, it was all about television. Cable as an industry was also much smaller than it is now, and it was divided among many more companies. They were the upstarts, challenging the big broadcasters. Being pro-cable was arguably being pro-consumer.

From 1992 to 2004, he was president of CTIA, the main cellular trade group. By then, the public internet was well under way, but it was mostly wired. Internet on phones was available, but it was more of a novelty or an expensive luxury, with voice and text being the main interest most people had in cellular. CTIA lobbied, of course, but they also had a major role in setting technology standards. Wheeler represented the industry in discussions with the FCC to drat the rules that we now have for cellular voice, which in retrospect worked out well (and are the bases for the Title II proposal he's expected to reveal).

It's also important to note that cell phones in 1992, when he joined CTIA, were not nearly as common as they are today. There was much less infrastructure in place, and you paid by the minute. They were past the point where you'd stare openly in wonder if you saw someone with one, but still were something you had to find a good reason to justify purchasing.

The key thing to note here is that when he has worked as a sort-of lobbyist (I say ""sort-of"" because both times he was president of a trade association that had lobbying as just one function), it was for industries that were young and had a lot of promise to bring great things to consumers, and his work for those industries as far as I've been able to tell helped consumers, and the customers of those industries were better off when he left than when he started.

He seems to basically be a telecom policy nerd. Heck, he even does telecom stuff in his non-professional capacity. Only a telecom nerd would write a [250 page book called ""Mr. Lincoln's T-Mails: The Untold Story of How Abraham Lincoln Used the Telegraph to Win the Civil War""](http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Lincolns-T-Mails-Abraham-Telegraph/dp/006112978X/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0).",114,t1_co60pil,harlows_monkeys,0,114,1422646608,t5_2qh16,0,technology

Cost, flexibility and customization is the name of the game.  

First, it's cheaply available.  You can grab one from Amazon for $20, and each new nib is about $13.  Converters are $4.50.  Plus, there are so damn many floating around, replacement parts are never far away.  So if you snap the body in a car door (too personal?) you can buy a new body cheaply and have all your nibs still work.

Second, the flexibility (not the nibs, obviously, they're stiffer than a preacher's peter).  Each new nib makes it a whole new pen.  The fine nib is great for notes, the broad nib gives you nice shading for those particular inks.  Each of the different calligraphy nibs offers a completely different writing experience as well.  The nibs are really easy to change on and off, as well as being portable and pretty durable. They're well made and write smoothly for the most part, though they do leave a little to be desired.  But, you can fix that!  So, onto....

Third, customization.  I just started grinding my own Lamy nibs just to muck about.  I mean hey, did you get into fountain pens because you just want something that JUST writes when you pick it up?  Bic figured that out already; they really work great but that's not why we're all here.  We're here for greater understanding and appreciation of craftsmanship.  There's nothing mystical about these nibs, and as cheap as they are you can afford to experiment.  It could be as simple as just making a sharper edge on a calligraphy nib to make better italics (my most recent project) - you have no idea how much better your normal, crappy old handwriting will look when you slap a 1.1mm calligraphy nib on your pen - it's like bringing out your inner Tolkien that you never knew was there!  Or you could just slim down a fine nib to take super tiny notes on a notecard before a physics exam (my first project).  The point is, it puts you in the driver's seat and it really doesn't take long.  Sit down for half an hour, work carefully, stand up with a new pen.

Protip: throw nibs in a contact lens case, take them everywhere.

Check out this page on grinding for some basics on making your own experimental nibs (http://www.marcuslink.com/pens/aboutpens/ludwig-tan.html), then check out this inexpensive knife stone, which will work great for both rough shaping and medium polishing (http://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Combination-Knife-Sharpening-Stone/dp/B0000Y7LAS/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420394243&amp;sr=8-10&amp;keywords=1000+grit+combination+stone).  For final smoothing, I'm pretty sure the standard Goulet micro-mesh paper will be great, though I haven't gotten around to buying one myself (http://www.gouletpens.com/GPC-Micro-Mesh/p/GPC-Micro-Mesh).

I've been playing around like this for a while now.  What I've gotten is a greater appreciation for well made, expensive retail pens.  I've also gotten better at spotting crap.  Once you've played around with your own pen, you'll know what you're looking at when you go to buy vintage pens in the future.  You'll understand the basics, and then can make an informed decision.  The best bang for your buck will be not making a bad purchase in the first place.  Start cheap, work up.  

Now that I've wasted everyone's time and all my wind, I do have to say the Metropolitan is a fiiiiiine pen, quite sturdy and writes like a champ every time.  So there's that.

**TL;DR** I think customizing cheap nibs is a great way to start, but the Metropolitan is sturdy and writes as well/better than many pens three times its cost.  The TWSBI has interchangeable nibs as well, is more upscale and you can tell the difference.  The Vanishing Point is great, I have two, but the ink tends to dry out more quickly then in my other pens, and the new nibs definitely have a premium attached - they were $25 when I was in college, now they're $65 and the pen itself hasn't changed price.  That ticks me off.

Here's the thing some of us have a past where those were the actual problems. Or we had eating disorders. or we were told that we were the ugly sister, or whatever. So those are real questions that we actually need the answer to. Especially if we think we aren't you type if we know who you've dated before. 


Clear communication is really important. Sometimes it needs to be repetitive.  Anything that you can do to build trust in those situations is important. If we are continually getting rejected, and by someone that we love, that gets really hard on a persons ego. It can take the most confident person and turn them into a pile of quivering sadness.

**Foreword:**

The following is my opinion predicated upon: theoretical framework (functionalism; neo-functionalism; intergovernmentalism; liberal intergovernmentalism;...), economics (macroeconomics; monetary policy; fiscal policy; bonds; interest rates;...), and history (EU; integration; framework evolution;...). And culminates in tying these factors together to present an overarching case. 

----


**Integration vs. Separatism**


In large part the problems, or perceived problems, derive from the early systemic institutions set up with the directive of federalization - in whatever form that may take. For example the Eurozone: The Eurozone has a combined monetary, but not fiscal policy. In economics we've already seen such a system fail - see: the fall of the gold-standard. That is to say you cannot have a shared monetary policy without a shared fiscal policy - but austerity doesn't work, and that isn't just a passing comment that is economics.


--

The primary fear - other than systemic limitations propagated by fear ending in self-fulfilling prophecy - is the loss of culture. This is simply short-sighted and, yet again, fear driven. In the face of integration we've seen the reassertion of regional cultural cohesion; Catalonia, Scotland, etc. A radical example of the applicability of cultural differences in the face of integration is the United States. The United States still has massively different cultural regions - with conflicting views, values, and ideologies. 


--

If anything integration allows for culture to be reasserted not undermined. When you're working together to common ends you needn't unite nationally to propagate nationalist goals - but instead you  identify with your culture, no matter how small or large, without having to play the 'lesser-of-two-evils' game. 

--

Federalism would've come in ~1954 with the European Defensive Community and European Political Community, if not for France vetoing the acts. They did this in fear of West-Germany rearming - a situation they wanted to prevent. But this proved futile as West-Germany rearmed the next year under NATO. 

--

European Integration has proven an odd natural experiment in supranational overtones subsuming international polarity conflicts resulting in inter regional multi-polarity. In political philosophy there are two conflicting views in aims of global peace: Unipolar; Multipolar. Unipolar would led to the term *Pax Americana* and the interventionist foreign policy of the last 50 years. While in contrast the conflicting views and lack of popular support (in large part due to wide-spread difference in values and ideologies resulting from cultural differences) make it hard to act aggressively on a united front for reasons other than direct self-defense. So fears of being forced into military action as a result of unification could not be more wrong. 

--

In conclusion I see integration as the best, and perhaps only solution. A common uniting 'Constitution' which outlays the general tendencies, powers, and limits on government. I would argue for this to be vague and serve as more of a 'Bill of Rights' or 'Common Values' over specific limiting texts. Inter-regional governments could very well split off from others, the need for large 'states' wouldn't be present when defense and politics are supranational. Meaning smaller and smaller regions could form with their own agendas regarding where investment goes, what criminal law is passed, and so on. In essence a limited federal Europe with proportional representation may seem scary but it would really empower each individual region far beyond they are now while assuaging fears of interventionism and national interest conflicts.

**My Complex Case (Towards Integration)**


So, about a year ago, I decided to pen a paper on the future of the European Union. Making my general case -- from the perspective of a post-grad economist, who has penned published work related to the subject. It is by no means meant to serve as a published work. Merely to outline my argument, present my case, and provide substantive evidence.

--

&gt; The solution to bring about long run stability requires more pronounced federalization, which in turn requires further supranational power and oversight, which in turn requires democratic legitimacy. There are several proposals; including direct elections of the President of the Commission or the entire Commission. But a huge problem right now is due to the European Court of Justice which, now more than ever, has a direct role in arbitration over institutions and laws. Because of the increasing breadth of competency has grown to cover customs unions, competition, monetary policy, commercial policy, international agreements, public health, technology and development, security, social policy, consumer protection and more. All without clear defined institutional roles.

--

&gt; Every step in the direction of cohesive integration has brought about problems, fears, and dissidents clinging to their national identity with atavistic prose. Only for their fears to be quenched and dissents mocked, all until a new concern should arise. The long-term solution is legitimacy, stability, and representation. For the alternatives are collapse, dismay, chaos, and political usurpations. And it is because of that risk, the neofunctionalist ball-and-chain, which further integration will march on in placing the capstone upon federation be it weak or strong. As the problems faced hereto result from opaque institutional authority, lack of legitimacy, and the lack of meaningful cooperation in ensuring regional stability and prosperity. The final viscous cycle that will be broken, the penultimate impetus of need, is the chain between national governments and their people. When people find legitimacy in the European Union any reversion needn’t call upon nationalism for succession.

----

**Unipolarity, Multipolarity &amp; Stability**

The inter-regional and multi-tiered checks and balances are complex, and for reasons of brevity I will not outlay those here. But it falls under the common theme of what I said above. A broad and common 'Constitution' protecting equal rights, due-process, and privacy similar to the [Charter of Fundamental Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union). I think it is our only hope for a long-term peace - where today any fall in global peace means our own demise. Nationalism and war are not longer a solution when fluid cultural and values shared through due-process are represented.

I called it my ""Masters Degree in Jazz Studies for Non-Musicians."" The first two courses I think would be perfect for you.
    
`    

**Course 1: Jazz Appreciation**
This course is meant to give you a solid grounding in how to listen to jazz music without delving too deeply in music theory or requiring the student to be a musician. It is also meant to expose you to the core body of work of jazz.

`

   **Course 2: Jazz History 101**
This is a basic course in jazz history. it is not meant to be an in depth coverage of every style. It is meant to give the student a broad overview of the general progression of jazz from it's inception into the modern era. Other courses in the program go much further in depth into specific styles and the major players of those styles.

`

so far the program I developed has 10 courses. If anyone is interested I could share the content of the other courses. and I am considering developing a syllabus for each course and possibly even more courses, but the time and effort needed to complete the 10 courses would already be more than the effort I put in to obtaining an actual master's degree from a university so I'm not sure how much more effort I would want to put into this right now.",14,t1_co3rb31,sksmith66,0,14,1422471245,t5_2qmm6,0,Jazz

The way to tell the difference is to say the words ""thin"" and ""then"": the only difference between the two words is whether the ""th"" is voiced or not. Place your fingers on your voice box and say the two words, and you'll notice that with ""then"" the voice box vibrates with the ""th"" - that's an eth; with ""thin"" there is no vibration - that is the unvoiced thorn.

https://www.amazon.com/Take-Your-Eye-Off-Ball/dp/1600783910,,Take Your Eye Off the Ball: How to Watch Football by Knowing Where to Look,"I usually find **[this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_strategy)** very helpful.  Your English is excellent so I don't think you need to worry about finding a translation.  Scroll down to ""offensive formations"" and the sections on ""running plays"" and ""passing plays"" to understand the terminology and how to understand what you're seeing.  The great part about that is that if you then search for those plays on YouTube you can find video of the play working well.  

I also like to recommend **[Take Your Eye Off the Ball](http://www.amazon.com/Take-Your-Eye-Off-Ball/dp/1600783910)** to new fans interested in Xs and Os.  It's an excellent book about how to watch football and understand what's happening -- it explains how an offensive formation is like a ""bid"" or ""bet"" in cards, and the defense's formation is a reaction to that bid, and how either side might be bluffing.  It goes into excellent detail about almost every aspect of the game.  

Give **[this article](http://grantland.com/features/how-troy-polamalu-ed-reed-changed-nfl-defenses/)** a read as well.  Chris Brown helps the reader understand the fundamental shift in the current defensive era, which I think will really help you understand what (for example) the Seahawks do on defense.  If you like Brown's work, he has also published **[this book of essays](http://www.amazon.com/Essential-Smart-Football-Chris-Brown/dp/1470125595)** (edited and expanded from his blog) which explain many of the strategic and tactical nuances of the modern game of football in a style similar to what you see in the above article.

&gt;
&gt; mom is angry that I’m letting her keep having panic attacks. 
&gt;
&gt;My mom had invited her. When I realized she was at the front door, I snuck out a back window before she could find me and drove away. Now my mom is saying I’m not welcome at home until I talk with my ex.

This is some class A emotional blackmail BULLSHIT. From your mom and your friends, no less! She cheated on you and deserves nothing. Your method of leaving (saying ""it's over"" with no words) was way better than blowing up, like you said. You got to avoid begging, crying, and pleading that might have kept you in the relationship. I can't believe those closest to you are dismissing that cheating is *abuse* and are pressuring you to soothe her bruised ego. No. She is having ""panic attacks"" because she is an entitled princess who can't have her cake and eat it too. The injustice of this is maddening; I'm really pissed for you, OP.

Stand your ground and hold your head up high. Repeat to others: ""I have no desire to contact her. It is over because she cheated on me, and that's all there is to it."" Your mom can't be trusted right now because she tried to force you to be in contact with her. Hold onto the friends who aren't pressuring you tightly. Remember you're not crazy or unreasonable!

https://www.amazon.com/Amsterdam-History-Worlds-Most-Liberal/dp/0385534574,,Amsterdam: A History of the World's Most Liberal City,"Ha, I would also assume that getting people to read it is unquestionably good in most ways :) But…I also wonder about if, in academia, there's a sense that a cover that's too good might not be serious enough, that it might be seen as sociologists see Malcolm Gladwell books or economists see Freakonomics.

Anyways: I think these sorts of historical stories, where you are looking at a modern-day state of affairs and retracing the steps and powers that brought it into being, are super interesting for a general audience. Elaine Pagels' *Revelations* and Russell Shorto's *Amsterdam* are two that come to mind, although that's a very broad grouping. 

I bring those up because looking at the cover, it feels very much like ""somebody had a PhD thesis and they turned it into a more readable book."" I don't know if that's the case with this or not, but it sort of looks like the sort of book you'd find in a university's library, where the professor who works there keeps 1 copy at the library and makes his students buy the remaining stock every year.

I might pick it up if I'm someone with an academic interest in history, but not someone like me who enjoys history as a general interest reader. And based on what little I can tell from the cover, it's a book that could potentially have a broad appeal with the right marketing — it's a topic that ties in with so many things in the headlines.

So, in terms of what to do: I might do some research at the local bookstore on what's hot in book covers at the moment. With a b&amp;w photo + one color, this can be very understated and elegant when done with expensive materials and processes, but as a flat image, it says ""academic work."" With Elaine Pagels' [*Revelations*](http://books.google.com/books/about/Revelations.html?id=-33IVLAc6dkC), rather than having a block of color over the image, it's just white type over the image. This tends to feel stronger to me. With Shorto's [*Amsterdam*](http://www.amazon.com/Amsterdam-History-Worlds-Most-Liberal/dp/0385534574), you have more of a collaged, geometric approach that you would probably want to have a graphic designer do if you were going to take a crack at that. I would also see how the image looks at like 100 and even 50 px across, since this is going to live primarily as an ebook. Again, context.

EDIT: the main thing I didn't express outright was that I think fiddling with the type but leaving the general layout as is will not make a big difference. There needs to be some intrigue, some emotional connection, that makes the reader click on your book amidst the search results for ""cold war history"" or whatever they typed into amazon.

Yeah. That.

These things are wonderful. They're magnetic and stick to each other so they're easy to get in and out and very easy to clean. I started sleeping with them in maybe 3 nights a week and in about two months I noticed a big difference in my vaginal muscle tone. I'm much tighter, have better control and, bonus, much less problems with incontinence when I cough or sneeze. 

Seriously, since I started using these 18 months ago I've gotten very positive comments from both of the folks I've been intimate with (something that never happened to me before) AND I've been able to stop using pantiliners as a default. I still resort to the Poise pads when I've got a cold or am wearing my nice underwear. So much better. And very easy. Much easier than remembering to do kegels daily. Just slip these in when you go to bed and take them out when you wake up. Wash and repeat.   ",40,t1_cnshdyk,mudcelt,0,40,1421550269,t5_2rxrw,0,AskWomen

You want diagnostic equipment that's straightforward, temporary, and relatively inexpensive and durable.

My initial reaction is that kill a watts are good- they are simple and very easy to deal with, and relatively cheap. Get a few.

The IR camera is useful, but only if you know how to interpret it.

I'd recommend that you get a copy or two of Residential Energy ( http://www.amazon.com/Residential-Energy-Savings-Existing-Buildings/dp/0133418960) since it's written in an understandable manner and is full of really great information.

Do you guys have natural gas? If so, I'd get a gas sniffing wand. Last thing you want is for a well meaning person to seal their house up tight and then have their house explode due to a gas leak that would have never built up in a drafty house.

A pro grade caulking gun might be helpful- most people would never buy a nice one but they make the job much better.

Get an IR thermometer gun. It's a much faster way to check surface temperatures, which could be used by somebody who wants to do some math about heat loss calcs.

The [Life magazine featuring WDW's opening day](http://www.amazon.com/LIFE-Magazine-October-Cover-Disney/dp/B000JK2694) has [this page](http://s843.photobucket.com/user/loaloauk/media/Disney%20Planets/life3.jpg.html) which has the same character labeled ""Giuseppi Cat"".

Further search for who this cat is led me to [this very interesting forum](http://mb.laughingplace.com/MsgBoard-T-121728-P-1.asp) that references [this image](http://www.flickr.com/photos/10202505@N05/3939445157/) which has similar-looking cats performing in the [America on Parade](https://www.flickr.com/photos/10202505@N05/sets/72157622290399163) show at MK.

I got caught in my tracks though when DlandDug from the forum pointed out
&gt;WDW opened in 1971. America on Parade was in 1976. It may, indeed, be the same cat costume, but it wasn't that character in 1971.

tonyanton from the forum said
&gt;The Aristocats opened at Christmas 1970 and was a big hit for its time. They were heavily featured during WDW's early years and were even in a stage show at the long-gone ""Fantasy Faire"" stage at the northside of Fantasyland (this was the later reused as a covered seating area with a Little Mermaid theme when Ariel began meet-and-greets nearby).

So Giuseppi Cat was most likely one of several promo characters for the movie [""The Aristocats""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Aristocats).

DlandDug again makes a good point with
&gt;For what it's worth, Thomas O'Malley's full name is Abraham de Lacy Giuseppe Casey Thomas O'Malley the Alley Cat. Giusseppi...?

which would give more clues pointing to cats.

**TL;DR:** Character to promote The Aristocats, most likely.

Then add one more layer to your current picture.  So you should have 2x4 on bottom, then 1x2, then pickets, 1x2, 2x4 on top, then optional 2x6 for something a little nicer.  Doing it this way allows you to place the bottom 2x4 first, then assemble the pickets/1x2s as one unit that you can place on top of 2x4, with final 2x4 on top.  Use the pocket hole jig on the ends of the 2xs  to attach to posts.  this will create an amazingly strong railing.   attach pickets to 1x2s using 3 or more 15/16 guage trim nails.

Find a specialty retailer for good woods, I'm particular to Madison Woods, pricey, but worth it.

Back in August I was in Chic-Fil-A grabbing something to eat on my way home from work. When I walk in, I see a NB sitting at a table in full regalia: sandals, khaki cargo shorts and matching fedora. I would say he came in at 5'5"" pushing 300 lbs. The M'lady on his arm was in jeans and a t-shirt.

It was 90 degrees outside in the shade.

At this Chic-Fil-A, they take your name when you order, and then call it when your food is ready. So I'm standing there waiting, looking down at my phone checking my text messages, and I hear the girl behind the counter call out ""Doctor?"" in the most awkwardly way possible.

Or cut down on extended family (we're doing siblings, parents, grandparents, aunts + uncles, and cousins. If my dad were paying, we'd be inviting all of my great aunts/uncles and their kids as well.). You're going to have to make some tough decisions here, but since you're paying for the wedding, stick to your guns.

After that, food and booze are going to be your next biggest expense. Scrap the evening full dinner reception. What about brunch with mimosas instead of a full bar? Or a backyard picnic, as /u/waffleandbear suggests? City parks are also great places for picnics.

Think acupuncture, herbal tinctures and pastes, bones and organs of animals, and an Eastern equivalent of the bile and blood ""Humors"" of Medieval Europe. The efficacy of these treatments is fairly low, for example [aristolochic acid](http://news.sciencemag.org/health/2013/08/common-herbal-supplement-linked-cancer) is common in several treatments including wild ginger and is found to cause a wide range of health problems; UTIs, various cancers, and even kidney failure with only moderate use. In the case of severe illness, Chinese medicine does not perform nearly as well as Western medicine, and as we see can even cause fatal problems.

The first Employee health insurance plan didn't grace Japan until 1927, so even with awareness of Western medicine in the country, access to it was probably not widespread. Life expectancy in the 1950s in Japan might be considered [abysmal](http://www.nia.nih.gov/research/publication/global-health-and-aging/living-longer) when compared to today's.

The reformation of the public health system following Japan's defeat in WWII is probably the biggest fish you're looking for, but unfortunately I don't know much about that, although [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Reforming-Public-Health-Occupied-1945-52/dp/0415681499) might be of interest in your studies. The biggest scandals in public health in the first half or two-thirds of the 1900s would have been [Itai-Itai](http://ic.ucsc.edu/~flegal/etox80e/Images/itai-itai.jpg), [Minamata](http://america.aljazeera.com/content/dam/ajam/images/articles_2014/minamata_japan_ontario_082914.jpg), and Yokkaichi asthma (caused by poisonous ash from a factory, shaved off five years from life expectancy, [on average](http://www.ehjournal.net/content/7/1/8)), all caused by the pollution of several factories into rivers over a period of about seventy years. After the last one, it seems the government clamped down more tightly on industrial waste, but again, I can't speak to that.

So, in the 40s in Japan, 50 was about the average life expectancy, but in the 50s an amazing leap in health involving new health regulation occurred which expanded a person's life 20 years, a 40% jump.

As you can tell, I'm no professor, but this is what I've gleaned from Google Scholar and some things my professors have mentioned. Please correct me, anyone who can.

My biggest issue - and it actually isn't with the Encyclopedia Brown character himself - was the lending of his name to:

[Encyclopedia Brown's Record Book of Weird and Wonderful Facts](http://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Browns-record-weird-wonderful/dp/0440023297)

This was one of those ""Weird Fact"" books that all nerds loved back in the day.  Filled with trivia and mundane ""facts"" about all sorts of things.

And so many of them were utter poppycock.

I cringe to think of how many of these ""factoids"" I regurgitated.  How much erroneous information did I squirrel away in my brain that was wrong.  Must I second guess everything I ever knew?

Donald Sobol wasn't the only perpetrator of mis-information.  But I trusted Encyclopedia Brown and by extension, I trusted Mr. Sobol.  And it is this book that burns in my memory as a pillar of fabrication and fancy.

https://www.amazon.com/Nazi-Germany-Jews-1939-1945-Extermination/dp/0060930489,,"Nazi Germany and the Jews, 1939-1945: The Years of Extermination","It is important to point out that not all concentration camps created by the Germans had the same purpose.  Recent research by the US Holocaust Memorial Museum has indicated that there were likely[ tens of thousands of camps scattered throughout Europe] (http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/sunday-review/the-holocaust-just-got-more-shocking.html?pagewanted=all) as part of a vast and complex network.

Many camps were set up as waystations for prisoners being sent along to other sites, some were permanent work/slave labor facilities, while others can be considered extermination camps where nearly every prisoner was killed shortly after arrival.  Some camps were hybrids (like Auschwitz-Birkenau) and served multiple roles.  

Many victims of the Holocaust who entered the camp system were sent rather quickly to extermination camps as Sobibór.  There were relatively few survivors of these locations with only 58 survivors following more than 170,000 killed at Sobibór. Because of this, most people who survived the Holocaust were ""lucky"" enough to have been sent to slave labor camps or hybrid camps.  Based on economic need and eventually the German retreat from Eastern Europe in 1943-1945, many of these survivors were moved from camp to camp. 

In other words, while many victims of the Holocaust were sent rather quickly and directly to their death, many *survivors* were sent from camp to camp before liberation.

I highly recommend reading Saul Friedlander's two book series on Nazi Germany and the Jews.  It is accessible to casual historians but draws information from relatively recent scholarly work.  Most of the material in this post comes from the second book entitled [Nazi Germany and the Jews: The Years of Extermination.](http://www.amazon.com/Nazi-Germany-Jews-1939-1945-Extermination/dp/0060930489)",60,t1_co1ka4k,greenflea3000,0,60,1422301609,t5_2ssp3,0,AskHistorians

Your child could be just slow to come out of his shell so to speak, but if you think there might be something more, get him assessed. It is too important to put off and cross your fingers. Best case scenario: you go in and the psychiatrist says your son isn't likely to be on the spectrum, worst case: you know what is going on and can start to help asap.

Early intervention is so helpful, the younger you can start a child with autism in some sort of therapy, the better. I looked up some resources in your area [A to Z Pediatric Therapy](http://www.atozpediatrictherapy.com/index.php) looks to be somewhat near you (maybe?). [Autism Speaks](http://www.autismspeaks.org/) is a fantastic site with all sorts of useful information. 

[This book](http://www.amazon.com/Early-Start-Your-Child-Autism/dp/160918470X/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_y) was recommended to me when we started going through the process with my son, and is helpful even if your child isn't actually diagnosed. It has a lot of good information and tips. 

Ultimately, the best advocate for your son is you. You know him best, you know what seems right and what seems wrong. Good luck, and I hope your son blossoms into your world soon. ",16,t1_cnpeh0t,Melodywish,0,16,1421290621,t5_2qhn3,0,Parenting

Yes, but you need [an adapter](http://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Wii-Pro-Controller-Adapter/dp/B00E6553PW) or bluetooth, some drivers, and a program.  I recommend the adapter, it works easier and better.

* How long does it take to charge? 

About 4 hours to fully charge.  That should give you about 80 hours of play.  It lasts long enough that you lose track of how long, but I know I did at least a 50 hour play through of Dark Souls II without charging.  You can just leave it plugged in to something overnight.  It will stop charging itself when it is fully charged.  The only catch is you need to turn the controller on to start the charging.  Once it starts charging you can turn the controller off and it will continue charging.

* I know with the PS3 controllers, you can plug them into the PS3 and it acts as a wired controller, making input speed faster. Does this work the same way with the Pro Controller? 

No, the plug is for charging only.  It charges faster hooked up to a PC.

* When bringing my Wii U places, do I even need to cart around the GamePad anymore, or can the pro do everything the same? (Minus the NFC reader, but I don't really use amiibos.)

To get started was a bit nerve-wracking. But then I thought all my landlords have been idiots, so it couldn't be too hard.  I did a simple math formula to see what my payments would be and checked local rents in the neighborhood. On paper it just made sense.  I had to pay $1000 a month in rent  with nothing to show for it or I could risk it a bit and pay nothing.  The extra $2000 a month would be a bonus and serve as a cushion for any emergency fund or repairs.


I scouted constantly, it was entertainment for me. Went to every open house until I felt like an expert. I'd ""get a feel"" the house was overpriced or underpriced after awhile and finally had the confidence to pull the trigger.

Consider how inert the mind feels compared to other parts of the body when undergoing stress or intense emotion (Heart, liver, gut/intestines). Different aspects of lived experience, such as religious rapture, inspiration, and fear were tied to different parts of the body, which would be felt as most active during these times.

Take a picture of her preferred brand and put an emergency box of pads  and tampons in her bathroom, just in case it comes out of the blue.  Check her bathroom regularly and make sure she's stocked up on supplies.  

Yes, I inferred from your post that she uses pads, but if she needs tampons, then she'll have them.

I feel like this is very open-ended so there is a lot to latch on to which is nice for /r/heavymind I think; it gets you thinking rather than delivering the message directly.

(pseudo-tangent) 
I usually try to judge the meaning of a piece on what I can get from it rather than what the artist intended cause it seems like artists subconsciously or accidentally include some great themes which shouldn't go to ""waste"" so if it feels like I am taking too many liberties in the below section let me know.

I feel like if in the future this sub grows(which it may not want to, idk), it would be on submissions like this which would avoid the consistent /r/im14andthisisdeep critique. But then again it's tough because an artist could fake this style by putting strange things together and calling it art and meaningful.

**Meaning**

(I'll try to stick to as concrete as possible) As I said before, you can think a lot about it. The main figure is floating above what looks to be a peat bog or a swamp and is holding a head and arms by the hair. The figure has a very uncaring attitude and is missing a face, so she really doesn't have any emotional connection to the fact that the head look like it is drowning. Also she is floating which is evocative of a traditionally spiritual or ""super-human"" character. She is drawn very realistically also. The head is flailing in the bog and our eye is drawn to it by her long hair. In society[traditionally,] someone with long hair is either considered beautiful (like a long-haired maiden) or in disrepair (like a homeless person.) This being without a body is being kept afloat by a ethereal being with no face. Interestingly, the head is not drawn as realistically as the body. It is has a circular profile and almost childlike features. So to recap, a childish head is being held by a realistic body with no face in a peat bog. The mature ""body"" is supporting her immature ""mind"" by her ""hair"" from being drowned in the ""bog."" This is out nearly complete abstracted sentence and when it is complete we can substitute the words in quotes fir whatever suites our fancy. The final piece is what the bog represents. Is the past the bogs had extremely spiritual significance and there were humans sacrificed to them. [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bog_body) and [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/british_prehistory/human_sacrifice_01.shtml).

So is the head(which might represent a mind) being sacrificed (by something) to the bog? Why would her body be trying to keep here above the water? 

The answer to the ""something"" would most likely be the house. and whatever it might mean. I'm getting a little long but I'm going to stop right here. 

The immature ""head"" [or mind] is being ""sacrificed"" by the ""house"" and being saved by a mature ""body.""

Definitely not the only thing that could be said, let me know what you think.

**On the artistic front**

I think its a bit drab and a little cliche. I feel like the pallette has been used a bunch of times which isn't bad per-se (because there are only a certain amount of colors than mix well) but I think it could have been something other than black and tan and grey-ish(but that would be tough and may not have the same effect so from an artists perspective it's not worth it.)

It has a rather [""Wolves in the Walls""](http://www.amazon.com/Wolves-Walls-Neil-Gaiman/dp/0380810956/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420565472&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=wolves+in+the+walls) art style to it which intrigues me.

I do love the composition though and because of it you can tell the artist knows what the hell he[or she] is doing. It is complicated where the focus is shifted to the right and the balance in general is on the right side but the eye is drawn from the head of the figure down through the hair and up again to the house which I think is cool. Its appropriately subtle and very well executed.

Well, the solution is to bring you information that is relevant specifically to you. The trend is to ""personalize"" the Internet for *you* instead of presenting you with an otherwise overwhelming amount of information.

You see it everywhere: in social media, news, and search results. There is a shift towards cultivating the mass amount of information available to you, *for* you. If you have 800 friends on Facebook, it's significantly more difficult for you to chronologically view *everything* that's happened. Using algorithms based on your likes, shares, page views, and general preferences, Facebook ""curates"" the information coming at you and presents to you the most relevant information. There is an insane amount of information available to you. If you were shown every status, every comment, every picture, everything that your friends posted in chronological order, it could be overwhelming or disinteresting to you.

The same thing happens when you use Google as well. The search engine ""learns"" from your searching patterns &amp; preferences, then extrapolates ""who you are,"" and returns appropriate search results. For example, if a sports fan searches for ""panthers,"" they're likely looking for information on the football team. However, a nature-lover would likely be looking for the animal.

**TL;DR there is a lot of information available to you, so the goal is to present you with relevant news to your interests**

The truth is that they can probably hold more, but I would consider the following:
  
1) You're cutting it close at 180 lbs
  
2) That rating is assuming a load in line with the hook axially, which you aren't doing.  You're creating a moment, which changes the situation.
  
3) The 200 lbs rating would be for a static, even load.  If you dropped the bar, causing an impulse, or racked it so that the weight was temporarily all on one hook, you could have a problem.
  
Considering all of that- don't do it.  If it were me, and you were dead set on using the studs in your wall for this purpose, I'd find something like a corner brace which has a triangular shape:

But with a hook or knob at the end and more heavy duty than that one.  Put some heavy duty screws in each one to hold it to the wall and I think that would serve you better.
  

If you're really set on using hooks or something similar, I'd at least double up and probably find something even more heavy duty as well.  In fact, use that advice for whatever solution you come up with.  Be safe, then double it.  I used to do pullups from a floor joist using 4 smaller hooks to hold the bar, weighing about 200 lbs.

In all seriousness, pretty much everyone here would recommend you get a solid pair of headphones and a separate mic. Coming from someone who used to use headsets, I can say that the separate set-up is much better.

However if you're dead-set on a headset, I've used the Siberia V2, Razer Tiamat 7.1, and HyperX Cloud within the past couple years so I can answer questions about those.

A quick set-up, and one that I use and love, is the [Sennheiser HD558's](http://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-HD-558-Headphones/dp/B004FEEY9A) and the [ModMic](http://www.modmic.com/collections/frontpage).

So no, I don't think I'm just making stuff up.

I'm not open to one of the greatest villains in literary history (yes, i mean that with out an ounce of irony or hyperbole) going from a scientific/magical genius (very nearly on par with Richards for science and Dr. Strange for magic) self-made-monarch and [turning him into just an 'antisocial hacker'.](http://collider.com/doctor-doom-new-origin-fantastic-four-movie/)

(except for the [squirrels](https://i.imgur.com/A5JWwoc.jpg), but that's a story for another time)

Tell me about his armor, tell me about his mistakes and how they drive him.  Tell me how he's more complicated, more human than any other villain, how he really does not see himself as the bad guy and why he's right.  This man has been judged worthy by the [Panther God](https://i.imgur.com/BeLGF83.jpg) (a test of character arguably fewer people have passed than have lifted Mjolner), [went to hell itself to rescue the soul of his mother with a selfless act](http://www.amazon.com/Doctor-Strange-Doom-Triumph-Torment/dp/0871356600), who [delivered his mortal enemy's child](https://i.imgur.com/ML9virQ.jpg) in order to save her and the mother when nobody else could.

If they do the character justice, I'll be the first one back here patting them on the back and shouting how wrong I was.

TL;DR - hollywood doesn't have a good track make hacking look cool.  It didn't work in Hackers, The Net, Swordfish, or Wargames.  Fox doesn't have a good track record for doing Dr. Doom well.

- When giving the customer a credit card slip to sign , don't say ""please sign this"", say ""please fill this out"".  If you say sign, people will immediately look for the signature line and might miss the tip line.  If you say fill this out, they will look at the whole sheet because it implies there is more than one thing to fill in.  Sounds stupid, but it works.

- Use the car toppers if your store has them.  I've asked multiple officers and they've all admitted they are less likely to pull us over for little things like not signalling or reasonable speeding if we have a car topper on.  Most of them realize we are just trying to do our job and actually have a reason to drive a little aggressively, unlike most people.  This isn't a foolproof plan and don't let it lull you into a false sense of security, but it's definitely not going to hurt.  It also lets you park just about wherever you want, nobody is going to tow or ticket a pizza guy. 

- Grab a can of Ozium.  Not the new car scent, it smells awful, there's a lemon scent that's amazing.  After a few weeks your car *will* smell like pizza and eventually you *will* get sick of it.  This stuff works really between cleanings.  

- Get a spotlight.  Not a flashlight, a *spotlight*.  I use [this one](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0071LF4FM/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_2?pf_rd_p=1944579842&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=B00BR1TP2A&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=036V9APB3GTC8SJ0B9R4).  It's bright as fuck (I brought it to St. Louis and standing under the arch, the beam went all the way to the top with barely any spread.) and makes lighting up addresses (which will be the bane of your existence) wayyyyy easier.  

- Buy a pen.  There's two approaches to this.  You can buy a ton of really cheap pens and not have to worry about losing them (you will) or people taking them (they will), or you can buy a really nice pen if you think you will be more careful about holding onto it.
If you want something in the middle, Pilot G2 is the best disposable (though you can buy refills) pen I've ever used.

- Have a spare tire, jack, tire iron, and jumper cables.  You will need one or all of these items at least once in your career, if not for your own car, for someone else.  

- Keep up the maintenance on your car.  Your car is going to be your biggest expense, so you *have* to take care of it.  This job destroys cars no matter where you live.  Keep the oil changed every 3,000, keep good tires on it, and keep an eye on your suspension.  You are probably going to thrash a ball joint or a tie rod end at some point if you do for this for any real length of time.  If possible, always keep an ""emergency car fund"".  Always have at least $200 sitting around for bullshit, because I promise you something on your car is going to break.

- Keep change in your pockets.  You  usually won't need it unless your customers are dicks, but having something jingle in your pockets makes the whole ""am i keeping the change?"" moment less common.  Most people will tell you to keep the change if they hear you digging around for coins.  This will also stop you from having to go to your car or get yelled at when you inevitability get ""that guy"" who absolutely *must* have his eleven cents.

- Learn how block numbers work if you don't already know.  On almost every street sign, you will see a number.  That's your block number.  So if you're going down the road and you pass a street sign that says ""Sycamore 800 W"", you know you just hit the 800 block of Sycamore going westbound.  So if the address is 845, you know you need to start looking here.  Most (key word most) streets follow a pretty consistent numbering pattern, so if the first two houses are 800, then 804, you know the next one should be 808.  Odds are on one side, evens on the other.  Don't get too comfortable with this though, some streets just do whatever the fuck they want.

- Learn the local streets so you can skip the highways when rush hour hits.  If your town is anything like mine, everyone only knows one way to get where they are going which usually means everyone packing themselves onto the highway.  You don't want to be stuck in traffic.

- Get a good pair of shoes/insoles.  Most stores require you to wear black no-slip shoes, but there's a pretty good selection of those these days.  If you can't find ones that are as comfortable as you'd like, look into insoles.  You are going to be on your feet and walking around all day, this will save your legs/back/feet.

- Sunglasses.  Self-explanatory.  Nothing worse than that shitty time of day where the sun is too low for your visor and just high enough to be in your eyeballs.



That's all I've got for now.  Good luck!  The job isn't always great, but it's rarely bad, and when it's good it's really good.  Honestly, the shittiest part is how much people look down on you.  People equate pizza guys with people at McDonald's or any other minimum wage job even though a lot of us make upwards of $20 an hour.  Don't let it get to you.  You're getting paid to drive around and listen to music all day, they're just jealous.

Any boot you get is going to be uncomfortable as fuck for the first few weeks. If you get a new pair, wear them around on weekends and going out. It'll toughen your feet faster so you aren't hobbled on the job as much.

What you might be able to do is keep a pair of sandals or slip-ons with you so when you go home at night you can take the boots off and leave them off.

I would *highly* suggest getting some Dr Scholls Gel Inserts. They're fucking incredible. Change them out about every four to six months and you'll get a lot more out of your boots. I guarantee you will notice the difference and it will be glorious.

When you can, get a second pair and third pair of boots and rotate them every day. If you don't they're going to get fucking rank very quickly and they'll break down faster.

On a side note: if you don't have them already, get some [good work gloves](http://www.amazon.com/Custom-Leathercraft-125M-Handyman-Gloves/dp/B0002YPZKY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420915221&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=work+gloves).

Edit: I have gotten a lot of questions on this. Start with your hair neatly trimmed. Yes, it works pretty much everywhere. No, it doesn't work fully the first try. It WILL take a little trial and error and multiple applications until you get the results you want. Then it'll be once a week maintenance. Wait a minimum of 24 hours between applications and use the calm balm a lot. FUCKING BE CAREFUL, you can and will get chemical burns if you leave this stuff on too long. Start BELOW the recommended times to leave it on and slowly increment from there. You have been warned. Sensitive area's I recommend just 4 or 5 minutes the first time you try it. It will burn a bit on your ""most sensitive"" skin. When I said gently, I was comparing it to EVERYTHING else on the market (Looking at you NAIR you POS).

It's worth nothing that Iris Chang's depiction in *The Rape of Nanking* has been criticized by historians for being overly sensationalized - not so much in the sense that her overall depiction is incorrect, but more that her conclusions are not fully supported by what evidence she has and she overreaches in her analysis of the motivations and psychology of the Japanese.  

If anyone is interested in further secondary (and primary) sources on the material I can dig up my bibliography.  For example the wartime diary of [Minnie Vautrin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnie_Vautrin) (an American missionary who worked with Rabe in organizing and running the Safety Zone) is fascinating, especially considering that she commited suicide after returning the US in 1940.  The entire diary is available online (along with an unbelievable wealth of other primary sources, letters and so forth) as part of Yale's [Nanking Massacre Project](http://divinity-adhoc.library.yale.edu/Nanking/).

This is true. However I'd be very cautious about equating the Revolution to the Constitution. Many prominent figures of the Revolutionary War were opposed to the Constitution. 

As for what caused the rift? It's my belief that the tipping point for revolutionary action came in 1773 after the Boston Tea Party and the over-reaction to that event by the British government. In 1773 John Adams was saying that he didn't forsee independence until his kid's generation.

Yet by the fall of 1774 Massachusetts was functionally a free state. 

&gt;Furthermore, it wasn't the King that initially started the conflict with the colonists. From 1763-1775, it was acts of Parliament, not the King, that continued to infuriate the colonists.

The King was *very* much involved in these acts. George III was a hands-on king, and became even more so in the early 1770s. He pushed for a strong reprisal to the dumping of the tea, seeing it as an attack on royal authority. 

He was also intransigent to offers of reconciliation from the colonies and was determined to take a hardline. 

&gt;Before declaring independence, the colonists even reached out (albeit half-heartedly) to the King with the Olive Branch Petition in an appeal to him to mediate the dispute.

This was mostly done as sop to the few remaining conservatives in Congress. Most members of Congress were well on their way towards independence before they sent this, but they agreed to try one more time. 

As for reaching out to the king directly through petition, that was part and parcel of Whig political philosophy. You could object to the laws and object to the ""evil ministers"" who made them, because objecting to the king or about the king was treason. So you made your arguments without directly mentioning the king.

It's why Congress declared themselves ""loyal subjects"", even while they were setting up a separate government.

Also it should be kept in mind that Congress was actually behind the times when it came to independence. In 1774 town after town in Massachusetts threw out royal authority. By the fall of 1774 there wasn't any royal authority in Massachusetts except what was in Boston. 

Other colonies were following suit. 

&gt;Regardless, if George Washington's long game was to make profit, why would he decline a salary for his command and also decline the opportunity to become king or dictator after the war was over?

While I disagree that making a profit was the primary concern of the men who rebelled in 1775, financial concerns were of great importance to them. British financial policy towards America had been terrible for many years. Trade laws were awful to Americans (which is one reason why they objected so much to any taxes--they felt they were being taxed via trade laws). Smuggling laws were horribly oppressive. Currency laws were old and out of date and caused massive problems. 

So profit (in the form of financial and economic issues) was absolutely a concern.

Also using Washington as an example isn't necessarily a great one. While it's true that he offered to serve without pay, he was reimbursed for his expenses--and some of those expense lists were pretty exorbitant. 

Also there's a school of thought in Rev War studies that points towards financial motivations as being one of the primary motivators. T.H. Breen looks at the Revolution through this lens in [*Marketplace of the Revolution*](http://www.amazon.com/The-Marketplace-Revolution-Consumer-Independence/dp/019518131X)

Of course his argument isn't that the leading men of the day were out to get rich, which is why they rebelled, but that British economic policies were a primary motivation in causing a split from the mother country. (Breen is a fantastic historian.)

It's my opinion that it's silly to put the Revolution down to one cause. I think that there were many causes that were all part of the same force splitting the colonies from England. 

I think that 1773 was the deciding year, and when Boston was blockaded and the Massachusetts government suspended, *that's* when things got bad enough for people to rebel. 

This is summed up best by Captain Levi Preston who fought on April 19, 1775. Several decades after the Revolution he was interviewed about his experiences. The interviewer asked him about the tea ""Never drank a drop!"". He was asked about the Stamp Act ""Never saw a stamp. I thought they were all burned?"". Was asked about the political theorists like Locked ""Never read 'em. All we had was the Bible and the almanac"".

&gt;""Well, then, what was the matter? and what did you mean in going to fight?'

&gt;""Young man, what we meant in going for those redcoats was this: we always had governed ourselves, and we always meant to. They didn't mean we should.""",18,t1_cnxxpz5,smileyman,0,18,1421982995,t5_2wo26,0,badhistory

Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars.
Now, he's sure he'll be the first person to die there.
After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he’s alive—and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive.
Chances are, though, he won't have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old ""human error"" are much more likely to kill him first.
But Mark isn't ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills—and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit—he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?",11,t1_co2waxr,militrix,0,11,1422400644,t5_2rzkm,0,SF_Book_Club

Charles Smith had a good article on it this week.

&gt;Especially fascinating to learn that the English Government provided ‘relief’ loans to Ireland at market interest with a condition that they could not be used to do anything productive. Basically they set up a scheme to pay a small proportion of each community to build roads, but not a cent could be spent on developing alternate Irish-owned industries or businesses for fear it would upset the rich English industrialists.

&gt;The English imported cheap American corn meal which everyone was forced to buy with the English Gov. financed wages (closing the loop of giving with one hand, taking with the other and adding in a profit to boot) after the Irish had to export all their own grain and livestock to England to pay the land rents.

http://www.oftwominds.com/blogjan15/debt-serfdom1-15.html

Similar tactics are documented extensively in [Confessions of an Economic Hitman](http://www.amazon.com/Confessions-Economic-Hit-John-Perkins/dp/0452287081). For example, instead of financing a war they might finance ""infrastructure improvements."" The IMF gives several billion to a dictator, the dictator steals a large portion, and the rest is (over)spent on Western equipment (turbines, cranes, wire, etc). The country remains on the hook, left with an asset worth a fraction of debt's value.

After the new regime took power, they squandered (some legitimate spending, the rest stolen or wasted) their foreign currency and gold reserves. Now, they are being financed by European and American banks with the ""condition"" that that money gets spent on weapons from these same European and American countries, ""closing the loop of giving with one hand, taking with the other and adding in a profit to boot."" It's a tried and true tactic. The end result is an impoverished vassal state, borrowing to survive.",16,t1_cnwypgn,Cialis_In_Wonderland,0,16,1421906852,t5_2qh13,0,worldnews

* Talk to your doctor.  Our daughter had thrush (white dots on the tongue, which makes it very painful for her to eat) and acid reflux (which was caused by the medication to treat thrush), and she was put on two medications which made a world of difference.  Of course, there could be something else going on.

* Get [this crib](http://www.amazon.com/Graco-Playard-Cuddle-Rocking-Winslet/dp/B005UV0USQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1421783822&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=cuddle+cove) with the ""Cuddle Cove"".  See that thing on the left side in the pic?  It has a vibrate function, and when we put our son in there (who also would not sleep) he passed out in 3 minutes for the first time (practically) since he was born.  It was a MIRACLE for us.

* Try feeding her in a more upright position.  

* Does she burp well?  If not, sit her down on your left knee, right hand on her chest, and lean her forward at a 45 degree angle and try to burp her with your left hand.  If that does not work, you (not the wife) can try to burp her holding her absolutely upright on your chest (which doesn't work so well for your wife as she has breasts ...) and try to burp her.  That worked very well for us.

* Put her in a dark room, as dark as possible.  If you gotta put towels on the windows, do it.  No night light, either.  Buy a sound machine and play it, but not too loud.

* Check out the book Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child.  Your daughter is a bit too young at this point, but at 3 months you should be able to get her on a sleep schedule where she is asleep for a total of 14-18 hours per day, with 12 hours being overnight.  That book was a miracle for us.

* Ask for help!  Get an experienced babysitter, or anyone who you can trust to give you time off.

* If at all possible, have one of you be ""on duty"" for 3-5 days, and then switch.  The person who is off duty should sleep somewhere that they do not hear the baby, so they can get a good nights sleep.  Figure out how to make it work, re-arrange bedrooms as needed.

* If your wife is breast feeding, have her pump her breast milk, and freeze it.  Then on nights where you are on duty you can bottle feed your baby.  Your insurance company (in the US) is required by law to provide you with a breast pump for free!

Good luck.  We've been there, done that, and it does get better.",12,t1_cnv9ap7,Jessie_James,0,12,1421785314,t5_2s7tt,0,AdviceAnimals

My lady loves sandalwood on me. Here are a few of my opinions on sandalwood and sandalwood-inspired scents.

[St. Charles Shave Santalum Album Extract:](http://www.saintcharlesshave.com/edt.asp) (EdT) This is a one-note sandalwood. Quite sweet and creamy, and almost gourmand in character. US$18 for 2 oz.

St. Charles Shave Limited Edition Sandalwood from Wood: (EdT) still a one-note sandalwood, but deeper and richer. Less sweet, a bit more woody. A friend of mine pronounced that it has ""more gravitas.""

Herve Leger Homme: (EdT) This is artificial sandalwood (ebonal, and maybe okumal) but smells quite nice. Brightened up with ginger and yuzu (a hint of fruity acidity compared to a creamy sandalwood) and lasts a long, *long* time. Unfortunately, this has been discontinued. Dangit!

[Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Cologne:](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00158N0VC) This is a sophisticated scent, with some lavender, floral notes, and patchouli, with plenty of powderiness (to my nose.) The sandalwood isn't very present at all, though it's a nice scent. Garnered compliments from my lady despite its sweetness and floral notes. Not very long-lasting, and wants a separate atomizer. (Used as a splash, it's too powerful, and cloying!)

[MPeG Santal Noble:](http://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Maitre-Parfumeur-et-Gantier/Santal-Noble-5252.html) Edt - A favorite of mine. Not super sandalwoody, but very woody. Smells like freshly-sawn cedar planks, along with amber, coffee, and spices. A superb scent, though not sandalwood-forward.

[Karnataka Mysore Sandalwood Soap:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysore_Sandal_Soap) This is a soap with actual Santalum Album oil (this is the ""true"" sandalwood, as opposed to the less complex ""Australian sandalwood"" and ""Hawaiian sandalwood"" oils.) Very little sweetness. The ""soap"" scent comes through clearly, but smells natural, as opposed to artificial. Over time, the sandalwood scent diminishes, but doesn't smell less ""real,"" only less strong.

[Every Man Jack Sandalwood Bodywash:](http://everymanjack.com/body/body-wash/body-wash-sandalwood.html) This is a gel, in a plastic showergel bottle. It's not real sandalwood, but is pleasant enough. The scent doesn't last beyond the shower, but my lady likes how it smells as I use it. Sweeter than Karnataka, and more artificial, but not bad for everyday shower duty.

Caress Endless Kiss Sandalwood Vanilla body wash: No. Just no. Got it home and was uninspired. I added actual sandalwood oil and actual vanilla extract in an attempt to salvage this, but it could not be done. You'd have better luck adding fragrance oils to an unscented body wash, in my opinion.

[Proraso Red (sandalwood) shaving cream:](http://www.amazon.com/Proraso-Shaving-Cream-Sandalwood-Formulation/dp/B0084GVSWG) This is a great shaving cream, expecially for the price. The sandalwood is very earthy, and not very sweet to my nose. Lathering is excellent, lubrication is great. The scent doesn't last after the shave, but it's great while it does. I carry a tube in my gym bag, and also use the stuff at home. Very nice earthy sandalwood scent.

[Nature de France Sandalwood Deodorant:](http://www.amazon.com/Nature-De-France-Deodorant-Sandalwood/dp/B004Z6K5YQ/) This is an earthy sandalwood, quite similar to the Proraso cream. Not sweet, not overly creamy or woody. No aluminum, so it's not an antiperspirant, just a deodorant. Still, I love the smell.

[Ogallala Bay Rum with Sandalwood aftershave:](http://bayrumdiaries.com/review-ogallala-bay-rum-sandalwood-aftershave-cologne/) This is an aftershave, based on Ogallala's spice-heavy Bay Rum scents (cowboy-style, as opposed to pirate-style ""pure"" bay rum scents.) The sandalwood isn't particularly realistic, but it is pleasant, and has gotten me more than a few compliments. It's a very sweet sandalwood, to the point where I sometimes find it a bit cloying. My lady never fails to compliment me, though, if I've used it, regardless of whether I tell her that I have. Needs to be shaken and -for best result- applied once your face is dry.

Partially true... but those ""subliminal messages"" are really just advertising to kids so they beg their parents and the ""chemicals"" are salt, sugar, and fat. It's not much of an excuse though. 

I only say this because I'm working my way [through a book](http://www.amazon.com/Salt-Sugar-Fat-Giants-Hooked/dp/0812982193/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1422482979&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=salt+sugar+fat) on the subject written by a food journalist. I think a lot of people will extrapolate their own meaning out of this saying ""I can't do it because I'm addicted"" or w/e. All I've gotten out of it so far is how hard-wired our biology is to loving that shit, not that anyone is ""addicted"".

It's actually been motivating me because if I crave something while staring at a vending machine I can rationalize that I don't *really* want it, my body just wants it because it's what I've been conditioned to like after years of not really caring.

Get a big storage box, one of the ones that looks like [this](http://www.uline.com/Product/Detail/S-15614/Sterilite-Storage-Boxes/Storage-Box-30-Gallon?pricode=WY814&amp;ds_e_ad_type=pla&amp;gadtype=pla&amp;id=S-15614&amp;gclid=CMK72-Xu88ICFUVk7Aod3XoAaA&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds).  (Not recommending that particular one, just an example of the style I'm talking about.)  You'll probably be traveling with this, for furcons and such, so make sure it fits in the trunk of your car and/or meets the requirements for a checked bag on your airline of choice.  I also highly recommend getting one with wheels so it doesn't take both hands and brute strength to move it around.

**Head Storage:**

Get one of [these](http://www.thecostumer.com/p-20360-styrofoam-wig-head.aspx?gclid=CI_Zxsnv88ICFW4V7AoduV4Aiw) styrofoam heads, and keep your fursuit head on it.  I got one for a buck or two from a nearby Ulta.  This will keep the inside in shape.  If your real-life head is bigger than the styrofoam one, you can bulk it out some with duct tape and scrap cardboard.  Wherever you keep your fursuit head, make sure it's not squished at all.  If your box is big enough, you can just leave it in there.  I keep mine on top of a bookshelf.

**Bodysuit Storage:**

You want to hang your bodysuit up.  If you fold it, the fur can get kinked, and it will never brush out soft and smooth again.  I use one of [these](http://www.amazon.com/HangAir-Drying-Systems-Wetsuits-Drysuits/dp/B0011G1F8S/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420152535&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=wetsuit+hanger) wetsuit dryers, and I highly recommend them.  It's made for holding heavier clothes than a regular coat hanger, the shoulders are rounded such that you won't stretch it the same way a regular coat hanger would, and, most importantly, it has a built-in fan in the top of it, which really helps your suit dry out before it can get funky.  Which leads me to suit care...

**Drying:**

Getting your suit dry after you use it is really *really* important.  Get a cheapo desk fan ( I have one of [these](http://www.amazon.com/Honeywell-HT-900-TurboForce-Fan/dp/B001R1RXUG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420152802&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=desk+fan) ) and put your head on it after you wear it.  (Without the styrofoam wig head inserted, of course.)  Hang the bodysuit up (ideally using the wetsuit dryer mentioned above) and lay the paws and miscellaneous bits out where they can dry.  Never EVER just take the suit off and leave it in a pile, or stuff it in your box.  Stuff will grow in it right away, and you will stink to high heaven.

It may be overkill, but I also keep some of [these desiccant packs](http://www.amazon.com/Hydrosorbent-OSG-40-Dehumidifier-Desiccant-Chloride/dp/B0037Z8K3E/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420153021&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=dessicant) in my box, just to make sure it stays dry.

**Sanitizing:**

Get a little spray bottle from a drug store and fill it with a 50/50 solution of rubbing alcohol and water.  Whenever you take your suit off, spray every surface down with this mixture, especially the inside.  This will help keep unpleasant things from growing in it.  Don't use undiluted rubbing alcohol, because it will actually evaporate too quick to finish killing everything.  Don't use febreeze, perfumes, or other sanitizers.  The febreeze and perfumes will just (badly) mask all the nasty smells without killing the source.  Other cleaners can leave residue, and most of them you really, *really* don't want to be breathing in the next time you wear your suit.

**Brushing:**

You'll want to brush your suit after you wear it, so that the fur doesn't get kinked and you don't look mangy.  Get a [wire cat brush](http://www.amazon.com/Four-Paws-Magic-Kitten-Brush/dp/B001OVF6VM/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420153632&amp;sr=8-12&amp;keywords=cat+brush) and run it down the fur with the hooks facing *backwards*, such that they don't catch.  You'll still pull out a little fluff, but it shouldn't be real bad, and you'll end up yanking out a lot more if you let the fur get matted anyway.

**Washing:**

Washing fursuits is hard, and to be avoided if possible.  If your fursuit smells noticeably, you need to wash it, but if you're letting it dry and spraying it with alcohol, you can go a long time before it needs to be washed.  Everytime you wash it, you'll inevitably lose a bit of the fluff.

Anything with foam in it is going to be problematic.  If parts of your costume are *just* fur fabric, you can machine-wash them.  Washing temperature depends on the fabric your suitbuilder used; consult them, or the store you got the fabric from.  Turn the pieces inside-out.  To dry, you can machine-dry them on NO HEAT/AIRDRY, or you can hang them up to dry.  Never use a dryer with the heat on; it's pretty easy to melt the fur together, ruining the suit.  You may be able to get away with the 'low heat' setting, but it's highly dependent on your dryer and the fabric, and I don't suggest risking it.

Pieces that contain foam should be spot-cleaned.  (Get a damp washcloth or something and just dab the insides, rinsing the washcloth out repeatedly.)  If that's not enough, you can submerge them in your bathtub and do some cleaning there, but don't do so if you don't have to.  You run a good chance of messing up your head if you submerge it.  Also, it will take a very long time for foam to dry; spray it with the alcohol and use whatever fans you have around to expedite the process.  Never machine-dry any foam parts; they'll likely break from the tumbling.",12,t1_cnbkt8j,sirblastalot,0,12,1420154317,t5_2t52s,0,fursuit

You are not the first person to experience this, it is not like it is so rare that nobody else have ever dealt with it. If you search for information, you will probably find someone who has more experience on this particuar issue.

I will suggest that you also cross post this to /r/sex 

I am no expert in this particular area, but I have some knowledge about sexual inhibitions.  ISD (Inhibited Sexual Disorder) is related to anything non-physical that is causing issues with you or your relationship to perform sexually. I will advise that you seek out therapy and counselling from someone who is an expert in sex.

I, and this is my opinion, believe that the resolution to this issue is for the most part to lay down on masturbating to this fantasy girl, while continuing being intimate, but not sexual with your girlfriend.  This advice you should take with a grain of salt, as it is what I think may be helpful, but it should be consulted with a professional.

There are [books](http://www.amazon.com/Rekindling-Desire-Barry-McCarthy/dp/0415823528)* that may explain a lot to you, I think seeking out a sexual therapist is necessary if you want to understand and get help to deal with this issue in a helpful way that does not cause any damage to your sexual self or your relationship.

*I have read it, and will recommend it.

When it comes to your relationship, you absolutely need to be open and honest with your girlfriend, but only if you trust her. I believe you can trust her, although she is young and it is hard to know how she will react.

As explained by our therapist (when my gf and I were struggling with an ISD) and in the book i linked to, an ISD need to be treated as a *couple issue*.  Sex is with two people, and it takes two people to solve issues related to sex. This is the most important advice I have. Even if the problem is originated in you alone, and you ""*possibly* can solve it by yourself"", don't treat an ISD as a sex issue for one person. Treat it as a couple issue where you and your girlfriend together as a team attempt to solve the problem.

You also need her support and help if you want to build a sexual relationship. This means that she will have to help you in 1. Understanding the situation and offer support, 2. Go with you to seek sexual counselling, 3. Assist in exercises and non-demand touching and intimacy.

There is also the issue now with your girlfriend’s feelings. She may be very hurt, insecure and upset because she doesn't understand what is going on. She may think that this has something to do with her, and while it is not the deal, she will believe it until she has reached an understanding of the situation. You will have to tell her if you wish to stay in this relationship.",14,t1_cnkm7wa,V3r1ty,0,14,1420910872,t5_2qjvn,0,relationships

I wish I would've gotten a few pair because I've been living in these things.  You can fold them down or wear them over the bump.  I was looking for ages for a pair of leggings that didn't have that weird crotch diamond on the outside, and didn't show what color underwear I was sporting.

Ecru Correspondence Cards & Envelopes (CC3116),"This is a bad idea.  It will seem ridiculous and socially inappropriate.  At best, people will simply be a little confused and weirded out; and at worst, people will be insulted.  
  
If you handed one to me, I would not want to take it.  If you insisted, I would feel uncomfortable, and absolutely never ever 'cash it in' under any circumstances.  I'd go home to my wife and say, ""you know that guy /u/probably_bad_idea? He gave me this weird coin today. You ever hear of anything like that?""     
    
Here's why: the give-and-take of favors is part of what creates trust between business associates.  Commodifying the process, which is what you are explicitly doing, ruins that element of interaction.  Whether or not this is actually true, it implies that you only do favors for others to earn favors in return, and expect that the people you interact with share the same worldview.  It says, ""I assume you're only doing this favor for me to get one in return, so I went to the trouble of making you this coin.""    
  
Another downside is, it's very impersonal.  No mention of what they did or why it was helpful; just a grubby poker chip identical to what some other girl got.   
  
[Edit to add: a third downside is the implication that you wouldn't remember what they did later on.  ""Hey, thanks for the favor.  I won't remember it tomorrow, so here's a special coin you can cash in to remind me.""  
  
A fourth downside is the implication that you wouldn't have helped them out beforehand, but now that you owe them a favor, you will help them out once.  ""Hey, now that you've done me a favor, I've decided to offer you one in the future if you need it.""  That's not literally what you mean, but it is the implication.] 
  
The adult thing to do would be to send a simple email.  If you really want to send a special message, you could hand-write a short note instead. (Perhaps put some of your coin-designing budget toward buying some tasteful stationary like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Crane-Co-Correspondence-Envelopes-CC3116/dp/B00647NTHY/ref=pd_sim_op_2?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=0HJY4W8F1JVMKX0YKBGC)).  
  
In either case, here's what the note should say, in three or four sentences:    
- Thesis  
- Evidence / Complement  
- General Offer (optional)  
  
For example:

My advice (especially for soupy recipes like the chicken noodle soup), is to put the noodles in just before you serve. They will stay firm that way. Otherwise the noodles will continually cook down and get more mushy.

Also, make sure you cut the noodles to a manageable size. Otherwise it will just make one giant, 10' long noodle... which is weird and annoying.",14,t1_cnmjv5e,a_retired_lady,0,14,1421079047,t5_2t46o,0,ketorecipes

If you are unhappy with your perceived promiscuity (because really promiscuity is 100% subjective), then absolutely talk to someone about it. However, if you enjoy having sex, then have it.

That said, it might not be the worst thing to see a counselor/therapist anyway in order to suss out where your shame is coming from. You might end up working through your abuse history and discovering that you still want to have that much sex. And that's just fine.

Military strategic theory during the Civil War had scarcely advanced past that which was advocated by Napoleon, as interpreted by the Baron de Jomini. American generals sought to grab territorial objectives in an effort to break the enemy's war effort, and force a decisive battle. The greatest practitioner of this kind of decisive warfare was Robert E Lee, a man who gained great fame for his decisive battles. Robert E Lee was so successful that he has become the paradigm by which Civil War generals are judged, and rightly so. I would argue that Lee better understood Napoleonic Warfare better than any other general of the period, save of course the Corsican himself. And Lee offers a useful paradigm, as many of his colleagues and adversaries sought to practice the exact same kind of warfare as Lee himself. 

But Ulysses Grant was different. He has often been accused of tactical and strategic incompetence. He was a fine battlefield commander, cool under fire, and completely able and willing to reconsider his approach given battlefield realities. In a strategic sense he was indebted to Winfield Scott, who was the mastermind behind the entire Union strategic war effort. But Grant did more to fulfill that strategic concept than any other land commander in the war. But still, Grant is weird. He was tenacious, and dogmatic. He was inflexible, unwavering, and undeterred in the face of adversity. Yet, rather than be destroyed because of it, his single mindedness allowed Grant to see the larger picture. Rather than fret over the results of one battle, one engagement, or even one campaign, Grant saw how each battle linked together in a great chain which would lead to victory. 

Grant's [Vicksburg Campaign](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg_Campaign) is an excellent example of how Grant never lost sight of his objective in the face of enemy resistance. Without going into every gritty detail, Grant's campaign was brilliant. In 1863 he launched an attack against the Eastern bank of the Mississippi when he had failed in a similar attempt the previous year. Grant operated far from his supply bases, completely detached from all resupply, and yet attacked his enemies and forced them apart. He divided the Confederate forces from one another, defeated one force, and then pinned another into a hopeless siege. In that siege, he completely destroyed the second army and forced it to dissolve. In that one campaign, Grant completely crushed the Confederate defense of the Mississippi River, and secured it for the Union from Gulf to Great Lakes. 

Grant's success in Vicksburg iconified his idea of strategy. During the Overland Campaign, there is a story of Grant's command style, it basically goes: During the [Battle of the Wilderness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Wilderness) the Confederates launched a major attack which threatened to route the whole Union line. This attack, which was very similar to Jackson's attack during Chancellorsville a year earlier, had forces several commanders to flee their regiments towards the rear. A messenger rode in to Grants HQ bearing these ominous tidings, saying ""General Grant, this is a crisis that cannot be looked upon too seriously. I know Lee's methods well by past experience; he will throw his whole army between us and the Rapidan, and cut us off completely from our communications."" Grant, normally a calm man, rudely replied ""Oh, I am heartily tired of hearing about what Lee is going to do. Some of you always seem to think he is suddenly going to turn a double somersault, and land in our rear and on both of our flanks at the same time. Go back to your command, and try to think what we are going to do ourselves, instead of what Lee is going to do.""[1] This single exchanged completely typified Grant's strategy, and why Lincoln so like him. Unlike the other officers in the Union Army, who eternally Lee's *maneuver sur la derriere*, Grant was indifferent. He was more concerned with how *he* was going to achieve victory, than how his opponent was going to magically defeat him. 

This is shown in Grant's Overland Campaign. Operationally and strategically, the campaign bears a striking similarity to Grant's Vicksburg campaign, a year earlier. Grant launched an offensive across the Rapidan River, where many other Union generals had attacked and failed. Grant, through a series of intense battles, pushed Lee down Virginia and into the City of Petersburg, where his army was besieged and practically destroyed. Infact, the city of Petersburg was critical to the Confederate war effort, and its loss ended all hope of coordinated Confederate resistance against the North. 

However it is here that Grant receives his greatest criticisms. When compared to Lee's successes in 1862-63, Grants campaign lacks finesse and seems clumsy. Grant's massive casualties, further, was far in excess of any other commander's during a similar (60 day) span of time. They argue that Grant's strategy was one of attrition, one in which he was continually defeated but lacked the good sense to abandon his efforts and try again by a different way.

To that I would adopt the argument of Russell Weigley's [*The American Way of War*](http://www.amazon.com/The-American-Way-War-Military/dp/025328029X) Weigley argues, and I whole heartedly agree, that Grant's strategy during the Overland Campaign was sound, and that it embodied the aspects of Grant's generalship that I have previously stated. Whereas other Union commanders were prone to retreat and abandon the attack to prepare for a later attempt, Grant simply continued to push Lee out of his positions. Lee's army, which after The Wilderness, was simply too weak to mount effective offensive actions, relied on the much lamented trenchworks which featured prominently in the 1864 and 1865 battles. But this is not Grant's fault. He repeatedly sought a traditional set piece battle, like outside of Jackson Mississippi, to defeat Lee. Lee simply refused to comply and was too good to let Grant trap him in such a battle. But even this setback didnt deter Grant, and Grant was still able to push Lee into Petersburg, where his army died. 

So, as Weigley argues, Grant ushered in a new era of American warfare. Following the Civil War, and especially after World War One, many American planners understood that it was Grant's conception of warfare that dominated modern battlefields. Gone were the days of Lee's Napoleonic style victories. Instead, modern battlefields were lethal and fluid. Casualties could be severe, but Grant's examination of the campaigns against Lee was correct: it was better to take heavy casualties and secure a rapid victory than to take lighter casualties fighting a long term and desultory campaign. Grant imparted his single mindedness and his determination onto the US Army, and it made him one of the most important generals of the Civil War in terms of his post-war legacy.

*A Note on Sources* 

A lot of research has gone into this post. I can recommend several good books on Grant, his campaigns, and the formation of his legacy. However, I have generally referenced the best books on Grant's campaigns, I feel, in the post itself. To that list, I would only add JFC Fuller's [*Grant and Lee*](http://www.amazon.com/Grant-Lee-Study-Personality-Generalship/dp/0253202884) which is a classic examination of both men, and their battlefield relationship.

https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Tattoo-Olive-Oatman-Women/dp/0803235178,,The Blue Tattoo: The Life of Olive Oatman (Women in the West),"&gt; In 1851 Olive Oatman was a thirteen-year old pioneer traveling west toward Zion, with her Mormon family. Within a decade, she was a white Indian with a chin tattoo, caught between cultures. The Blue Tattoo tells the harrowing story of this forgotten heroine of frontier America. Orphaned when her family was brutally killed by Yavapai Indians, Oatman lived as a slave to her captors for a year before being traded to the Mohave, who tattooed her face and raised her as their own. She was fully assimilated and perfectly happy when, at nineteen, she was ransomed back to white society. She became an instant celebrity, but the price of fame was high and the pain of her ruptured childhood lasted a lifetime.

Based on historical records, including letters and diaries of Oatman’s friends and relatives, The Blue Tattoo is the first book to examine her life from her childhood in Illinois—including the massacre, her captivity, and her return to white society—to her later years as a wealthy banker’s wife in Texas.

Oatman’s story has since become legend, inspiring artworks, fiction, film, radio plays, and even an episode of Death Valley Days starring Ronald Reagan. Its themes, from the perils of religious utopianism to the permeable border between civilization and savagery, are deeply rooted in the American psyche. Oatman’s blue tattoo was a cultural symbol that evoked both the imprint of her Mohave past and the lingering scars of westward expansion. It also served as a reminder of her deepest secret, fully explored here for the first time: she never wanted to go home.

Here's the list! Hope it's not too long. All the tools listed are the ones I bought. If I have other suggestions, I've listed them as well. I've also listed details on the functions of the tools, and why they're superior to some other alternatives. If you look for the same amount of tools in one of those ""kits,"" they would set you back roughly **200-400**, depending on where you bought it from. The tools in these kits are usually quite inferiorly made as well. This list is a result of about a week long search and perusal. Tandy is a well known and easily accessible aggregation of tools, but they're overpriced for what they do and their quality is mediocre at best. 

* **Stitching Chisel Set** [Amazon - $19](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CBRVKOK/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - Used for even stitching holes. An alternative to this tool would be something called an [overstitch wheel](http://www.amazon.com/Tandy-Leather-Craftool-Spacer-8091-00/dp/B0038HWMB2/ref=sr_1_1?s=arts-crafts&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1422308951&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=overstitch+wheel), but from what I've read, the consensus seems to be that pricking irons are better and more reliable for straight lines. Also, overstitch wheels don't pierce the leather all the way, and only mark the holes, meaning that you have to pierce each hole individually with an awl after you're done. Double the work. 

* **Stitching Groover &amp; Edge Trimmer** [Amazon - $22](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OHAHICM/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - This tool combines three tools into one. The edge groover, edge trimmer, and fold liner. It's not amazing quality admittedly, but it gets the job done well, and for the price I really can't complain. The edge groover cuts out a thin channel which sets the thread in deeper in the leather. Edge trimmer smooths the sharp corners, and the fold liner makes a line if you want to fold the leather somewhere. 

* **Cutting Mat** [Amazon - $10](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015AOIYI/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - I'd say absolutely necessary for anything leather related. This one is really cheap, works great. I have the 18x12 inch model, and the price is for that one as well. 

* **Hole Punch Set** [Amazon - $9](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002964CC/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - I'd say this one is more on the optional side. Mostly needed if you're interested in putting in hardware like rivets or snaps. Also good however for oblong rounded holes, like I showed in my project.

* **Mallet** [Amazon - $8](http://www.amazon.com/TEKTON-3179-35mm-Double-Face-Mallet/dp/B000NPR2U8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1422312020&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=mallet) - Needed for all sorts of things. A normal metal hammer won't work because it won't absorb any force at all and all energy will be transferred to the leather, potentially damaging it. A rubber mallet allows for a softer hit.


* **Diamond Stitching Awl** [Ebay - $9](http://www.ebay.com/itm/121495146906?_trksid=p2060778.m2749.l2649&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT) - While technically not necessary if you're using a stitching chisel, if the leather you're working with is extremely thick, it might help to have it. You should get one anyway though. You'll inevitable end up using it. Also, make sure to get a ""Diamond"" pointed one. Normal awls with round points just poke a hole in that doesn't close back up. Diamond points are wide and thin, and this allows the leather to close back up on the thread after it has been sewed up. C.S. Osborne is also American made. 

* **Skiving Knife** [Ebay - $9](http://www.ebay.com/itm/121519014223?_trksid=p2060778.m2749.l2648&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT) - Needed for thinning leather when folding, or simply trimming thick leather. There are several different styles, and they all definitely require a bit of finesse to be used properly, but are immensely rewarding once learned. Also a C.S. Osborne.

* **Bone Folder** [Ebay - $7](http://www.ebay.com/itm/141506979936?_trksid=p2060778.m2749.l2648&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT) - One of the tools you can improvise for. It's needed to crease corners when folding to flatten them out. Also can be used to burnish. The cocobolo burnisher that I made ended up working just as well as this for folding as well. Any smooth, rounded/flat long object will work well for this. This one is also a C.S. Osborne. 

* **Harness Needles** [Ebay - $7](http://www.ebay.com/itm/321500247324?_trksid=p2060778.m2749.l2649&amp;var=510383935127&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT) - Size 2 is what I got, and it fits with 0.8 thread, also what I used. These needles are handy because the tips are somewhat rounded, which means no pricked fingers. Comes in a pack of 25, and the first two that I pulled out are still going strong, so they're quite sturdy.

* **Ritza ""Tiger"" Thread** [Ebay - $7 for 25m](http://www.ebay.com/itm/321643365564?_trksid=p2060778.m2749.l2649&amp;var=510538992386&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT) - Obviously endless varietes of alternatives here. However, in my research it seemed to be the consensus that this was the superior thread. It comes already waxed, and it's extremely durable. The 0.8mm size fits the size 2 needle, and both are great for small projects.

* **Barge Cement** Ebay - [$4](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Barge-All-Purpose-Cement-Leather-Rubber-Wood-Glass-Glue-2-oz-/301337711269?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item46292092a5) or [$23](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Barge-Original-All-Purpose-Cement-Toluene-1-Quart-1QT-32Oz-Quabaug-Tin-Can-/140752463547?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item20c58026bb) - Barge cement is a well known glue for leatherworkers, and works well. It's used to hold edges together to make sewing easier, as well as holding folds down. The thing is, they released a new formula, (the $4 one) that is ""eco-friendly"" and is missing some key chemicals. This is the one I got. It also kinda sucks at holding leather together. The original formula, (the $23 one), comes in a quart size at the smallest, but from what I heard this one is rock solid and the origin of their reputation. If you're planning on doing many projects I'd just say to invest in the quart.

* **Stitching Pony** [This is what it looks like](http://d31snyb1jsf9xb.cloudfront.net/services/image.aspx/media/images-product/Pro-Lacing-Stitching-Pony-3133-00.jpg) - I didn't put a link to a product for this one because all the ones I have seen are ridiculously overpriced. I made my own out of some more scrap hardwood I had laying around, (you can barely see the tip of it in the sewing picture [here](http://i.imgur.com/7Vz2ZCi.jpg) and it works flawlessly. It's used to hold the leather together so you can saddle stitch it, which requires both hands. Besides the wood, it cost me about $3 in hardware to make my own. You can easily whip one up with some 2x4s and a long bolt, knob, and some screws, for a grand total of probably $5 from home depot. You may need a table or miter saw, or equivalent.

***Some of the eBay listings might have ended, but I'm sure you'll be able to find identical tools for the equivalent price or even cheaper. 

For me the tools came out to a grand total of roughly **$115**. You can give or take $20 if you want to improvise your own tools, or switch them out. I'd say this setup works just fine for mid to smaller projects like what I made, or wallets, etc. 

As for the leather, [Springfield Leather](http://springfieldleather.com) sells some quality leather by the square foot, which is nice for first timers, as most tanneries only sell by the side, like what I had, which usually average around 21-28 square feet. Pretty big investment. [Maverick Leather Company](http://www.maverickleathercompany.com) sells quality leathers as well as Horween ""Seconds"", like what I got for a very nice discount. These seconds are full sides with minor defects in the leather, but unless you're making huge bags it's easy to cut around the brand marks/scars etc, and your leather will look spotless. I got a full side of Horween Essex for roughly **$130**, and I'm guessing if I bought the same straight for Horween it would have run me in the ballpark of **$300** or so. Since my laptop case only used about 7-8% of my leather, I used about **$10** worth of leather. Quite a bargain if you ask me. If you're looking to do many projects like I am, I'd advise you to invest in a nice Horween side. Can't beat it for value and price.

All told, the laptop case itself cost about **$11-12 worth of materials** (leather, fabric, thread, glue) and took the better part of 2 days to complete. Granted, much of that time was spent just sitting and thinking as most of it was improvisation, as you can see by my horrible sketch. 

As far as my ""learning"" went, it was literally just Google. Some youtube videos help, and I glanced through some forums, but overall, as I've often found in woodworking too, nothing beats hand-on experience. 

Well, hope this helped you guys out and answered some questions. I know I definitely would have appreciated a specialized list like this when I was starting out.

He may be causing fans some pain in the short term, but by buying so many so fast he's actually giving Nintendo more incentive to re-release these lines of amiibos down the road. Hell, this would probably be a great article to email to Nintendo for them to justify producing more stock. But giving him a platform to spout a bunch of hate was incredibly irresponsible, and thanking him and wishing him luck at the end just cemented this site's status as a garbage online tabloid in my eyes. So fuck this guy, and fuck this shitty ""news site"". End of story.

Edit: Haaahahaha, oh man. So I went ahead and called out the author of this rag on giving this douche a platform, and his response after just two messages is ""Cry more please"". So yeah, this is undeniably a clickbait article by a desperate blogger.

Edit 2: HOLY SHIT HE DELETED THE ARTICLE! Oh man this is too good.

""Tabloid schmucks like this have no concept of accountability or self image, they just keep scraping the bottom of the barrel until they realize they’re digging themselves into a hole. I have no vested interest in this site, and he has no way to justify his support of this moron, so all I have to do is push a bit here and there to get his true colors to show brighter and brighter.

Immediately after that I archived the page, since I had a feeling he couldn't handle being called out;

I guessed right. Dude wiped the comment, but because of their shitty anonymous comments section, I was able to just keep putting it right back up there. Went back and forth maybe 3 times until good ol' Randy decided to pull the article entirely.

You have to take into account that for every drug that passes FDA, many more fail, which is a complete loss of money.

My Drug Development textbook says on that estimate: It takes on average 10-12 years and $1 billion USD to whittle 10,000 drug candidates down to 1 FDA approved drug.

FUN FACT: There haven't been any big blockbuster drugs in years and the current bellcows of profit are going to run out of patent soon.

Most big pharma companies are spinning off their Pharmaceutical departments into separate companies because the market is drying up^1 for NMEs (new molecular entities) and they want the spin-off to fail gracefully while the main company continues work in currently profitable sectors like biologics and medical devices. 

^1 Remember that FDA approval process of phased trials requires more evidence than safety, it requires efficacy data. Efficacy not only against placebo, but also must prove efficacy against the current standard treatment. As in you can't just automatically expect a ""similarly good"" drug to be approved.

I posted this is another topic couple months ago, which includes items I use most so your mileage with some items may vary:

- Kitchen utensils: [mdallison has a good list](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1yo5nw/bifl_request_graduation_gifts_and_college/cfmbu57). Don't need to buy it all at once. I would say you can start off with: frying pan, sauce pan, baking pan, cutting board, chef's knife, Scissors, tongs, tupperware, spatula, wooden spoon, ladle. Gradually buy other stuff if you need it to spread out expenses. 

- [Toaster oven](http://thesweethome.com/reviews/the-best-toaster-oven/): can be used for toast, baking, broiling, warming. 

- [Electric Kettle](http://thesweethome.com/reviews/the-best-home-kettle/): hot water for coffee, tea, boiling water to be cooled later if you don't want have a water filter system/pitcher.

- [Slow cooker](http://www.amazon.com/Breville-BRC600XL-Risotto-Sauteing-Steamer/dp/B008P8LA7G): The one I linked is multi-purpose. Ricecooker, risotto maker.

Do you drink coffee? I personally use a [Bodum French Press](http://bodum.bodum.com/us/en-us/shop/detail/11170-16/). I've heard good things about the [Aeropress](http://aerobie.com/products/aeropress.htm) and a [Chemex](http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/). I have a small space so I prefer these to a larger coffee machine. Keurigs and other cup based beverage makers I don't use because the cost of those disposable cups adds up but I can see why people like the convenience.

I used the TED talk and the book [How to Grow Fresh Air](http://www.amazon.com/How-Grow-Fresh-Air-Plants/dp/0140262431/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420649273&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=how+to+grow+fresh+air) to pick my plants. I have snake plant, English ivy, golden pathos, areca palm, and peace lily primarily but I do have others that I grow just because I enjoy the look of them. 

I live in a house that was built within the last ten years. All of the new carpet, paint, etc. is off gassing. Weather and my husband's seasonal allergies prevent me from opening the windows as much as I'd like. We cook a lot and have pets. I started noticing that the air in the house was stale and sour. 

I didn't have a huge budget for plants so I got the smallest/least expensive that were available at my local nursery. The cheapest were 99 cents and I don't think I paid more than $5 for the most expensive. Since the pots were small those were also pretty cheap. The one thing I didn't skimp on was soil. I got the best potting soil they had. But again since my plants and pots were small I didn't need that much.

I began to notice results the next day. I walked in to my house and where before the air would seem heavy, sour, just off somehow...I took a breath and was just breathing clean air. 

The plants require maintenance of course. After a while I began to notice that the air wasn't as fresh as it was when I had first gotten them. I didn't know you had to dust/clean the leaves.  I took a damp paper towel and gently wiped all of the leaves. As soon as I did that I got my wonderful fresh air back. I tried to put them all on the same watering schedule. Some of them dry out in a day and a half, others take a week or more. So I had to start doing quick do you need to be watered checks every day or two for a while. Now I have a pretty good schedule.

But I do know one thing: it is better that you are still breathing than the guy you killed.

If the guy was interested solely in money, he wouldn't have returned. He would have gotten the money and left. You saved yourself and your coworkers by doing what you did. Its an unbelievably shitty thing to have to do, but you did it for the right reasons.

You're getting therapy, keep at it. Many of my firends have gotten therapy for PTSD, and there's no shame in it. After our deployment, my best friend dove straight into a bottle and didn't come out for better part of a year. His job performance and live spiraled out of control, but he got better eventually.

That being said, your therapist may not be the best one... Don't be afraid of getting another; go to your local VFW, explain what happens to any veteran there around age 25-35 and you have better than even odds that they have a therapist to recommend, one that's used to PTSD from folks having shot at people.

Last thing I'll recommend. There's 2 book out I recommend for any servicemember before deployment, and if they have any issues with post-deployment life. Both are by Dave grossman.

[On Killing](http://www.amazon.com/Killing-Publisher-Back-Books-Revised/dp/B004N77AAE/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8) Basic Premise: That killing is fundamentally destructive to the psyche, and to overcome our natural disinclination towards killing, the military has created training programs that help circumvent this and allows them to kill. This training does nothing to alleviate the PTSD killing causes. (You could skip this book, but it shows the mechanism of why you are hurting and that may help you. It has lots of stories for you to see that you're not alone, which is also helpful.

[On Combat] (http://www.amazon.com/Combat-Psychology-Physiology-Deadly-Conflict/dp/0964920549/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8) Basic Premise: If you buy everything said in 'On Killing', that killing tears at your soul and psyche, then this is a book for Soldiers and Police to minimize the hurt and pain they are going through with what society asks of them. Some of the stuff would have been good to know before you killed the guy, but lots of it can be applied now.

Keep your chin up, and know that memories will fade. You did nothing wrong and your life is more important than the man who was going to kill you.

PM me if you want to, I may not have the PhDs your therapist does, but I've got life experience and come tons cheaper comparatively.

It's pretty simple if you buy the right equipment, but ""the right equipment"" is expensive and improvising is fiddly.

I'd recommend looking [this site](http://www.sweetmarias.com/library/roast-coffee/) over some, they have a lot of introductory guides and such. /r/roasting is also an awesome sub in general.

The biggest issue with home roasting is that the beans need to move continuously, for the entire roast, or else they get burned. There are some ways to do this with improvised equipment though:

-Using an air (popcorn) popper. Assuming you have the right model, it *does* get hot enough to roast coffee, and the beans are light enough to blow around in the interior chamber nonstop. It gets pretty messy though, and you don't have much control. You also can't do huge batches of coffee all at once. 

You should have a dedicated popper just for coffee, since you don't want the different oils mixing. Also, some poppers aren't powerful enough, and many modern ones have safety features that'll automatically shut off before it gets hot enough. Some people have fun with disabling those features and/or modding their poppers to give them more control.

""The Poppery II"" is a commonly-suggested model for air roasting like this. They don't make them anymore, but they were made like tanks and so you can often find them in thrift stores.

This is a good, cheap, intro way to do it, though the lack of control is annoying. The flavor develops in part based on how long it's kept at each temperature point, and an air popper gives you very few options for adjusting temperature.

Alternatively,

-Using a stovetop popcorn roaster, like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Wabash-Valley-Farms-25008-Whirley-Pop/dp/B00004SU35/). It has a handle that allows you to stir the coffee continuously, and it can work pretty well. The main drawback is monitoring/nailing the temperature, which is tricky. It's easier with a gas stove.

There are other methods as well, like using a heat gun, but I've never tried them and can't comment. I should also point out that *everything* I've just explained is a fire hazard, as is coffee roasting in general - the beans need to get quite hot, and they give off a thin, paperlike substance called chaff. I've never had a fire, but it's something you need to be aware of and plan for accordingly.

-If all of that sounds like too much of a hassle, you can just buy an actual coffee roaster. They make it *way* easier, and you can generally roast much larger batches at once. Sadly, they tend to be pretty expensive.

I'd recommend [this one](http://www.sweetmarias.com/store/roast-coffee/drum-roasters/behmor/behmor-1600-roaster-7223.html), which is actually on the very inexpensive end for a roaster. It's good quality though, and I've had one for over 1.5 years now without issue. Also note that the site I linked includes 8 pounds of free coffee when you buy from them, and (at least when I bought mine) they charge the same price for the unit as everyone else. So that's nice.

I really like roasting my own coffee. It can be a pain at times, but it means I always have fresh-roasted coffee available. Unless you buy from a local roaster, you've probably never had fresh coffee before. Whole bean coffee goes stale in like a week, and grocery store coffee is *much* older than a week. Pre-ground coffee goes stale in like minutes or hours.

They cover the stale taste up by burning the shit out of their beans, and so almost everything you see in a grocery store is only 1-2 stages removed from being charcoal. [This page](https://www.sweetmarias.com/library/content/using-sight-determine-degree-roast) shows you what the beans look like at every stage, and you can see how ""french roast"" actually means ""burnt to hell.""

Man, long post! At any rate, roasting your own coffee can be quite nice. Green coffee beans run around $4-6/pound normally and you can sometimes find it for even cheaper. At least where I live, even burnt grocery store coffee is often *much* more expensive than that. So you're paying less for better quality -- as long as you don't mind improvising, or a big up-front investment.

Edited **tl;dr**: It's a good way to save money *and* get better coffee, though it can be either annoying or require a big upfront investment. [This page](http://www.sweetmarias.com/library/roast-coffee/) has a lot of good introductory info on the whole process.",44,t1_cnbg4pe,Sometimes_Lies,0,44,1420145136,t5_2sw5r,0,firstworldanarchists

TSS isn't really that big of a concern most of the time.

If you put one in at the start of your shift and didn't change it until after, you'd still be okay. But they'll stop absorbing as much after a while, so you'll probably just feel like changing it more often. Plus, as you use them more, you'll be more aware of it.

One thing I'll add- wet wipes. If you're going to have blood on your hands, make sure you have something to get it off with in the bathroom before you have to pull up your white pants.

All the famous investors started reading at a young age and read ferociously (ok maybe not all but most).  

Go to the library if you can, they generally will have all the quality investing tomes, without some of the ""get rich quick manuals"" which only benefit the authors.  

Here is a few books to start with:

* [The Bogleheads Guide to Investing](http://www.amazon.com/Bogleheads-Guide-Investing-Taylor-Larimore/dp/0470067365) You could start here. Pretty good introduction.
* [A Random Walk Down Wall Street](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393340740/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_1?pf_rd_p=1944687782&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=0393330338&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=12751SSJHN00VZYF06B8)
* [The Richest Man in Babylon (PDF)](http://www.ccsales.com/the_richest_man_in_babylon.pdf) This is a quick read, and more a story than anything.  Still worth it.  
* [The Little Book of Common Sense Investing] (http://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Common-Sense-Investing/dp/0470102101/ref=pd_sim_b_3?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=16QN03Q9GFZ6NG5PPJ6P)

Most of this stuff is investment theory.  To be a successful investor as an average American, without a job in the finance industry, you probably don't have to read all of those books. If you really want to get into investing, that's a good place to start.  

Also, the Bogleheads book is a great one to start with because you can decide if you really are interested in investing. If not, that book is good personal financial advice regardless who you're getting paid. It will benefit the regular American.

* Learn the major roads (and side roads!)
* Use the maps outside of apartment complexes! I can't tell you how many times I've heard new people complaining about certain complexes and how they spent 20 minutes driving around trying to find the right building. Take 10-15 seconds looking at the map (almost always at the entrance), figure out where to go. Often times it will even show where the room is in the building, saving even more time. 
* Double check the order. Then check it again, because forgetting stuff is a bitch. 
* You will get lost, and you will forget stuff. Don't take it too hard, it happens, just make sure you learn from it.
* Bring music/podcasts to listen to whilst driving and keep yourself entertained.

* Many, if not most stores have a list of gate codes on the wall (or at least the chain I work at does...). Take a picture of it, it may come in handy. 

* Try to memorize the gate codes best you can. While most people will put them down for you in the driver instructions, a lot of people don't, and it saves you the time to look it up on your phone or calling the customer and asking. 

* Don't speed. It's not worth getting into an accident, or having customers complain. One of my coworkers last week actually ended up hitting a pedestrian. Your'e going to be on the road a lot more, so your risk level is a lot higher. Seriously, drive safe.

Basically, there are three completely different products made by grinding corn, any of which could potentially be called ""corn flour"".

1.  Corn meal is simply ground corn.

2.  Masa is ground hominy, which is corn that has undergone nixtamalization, where it is soaked and cooked in lime (calcium hydroxide), which significantly changes the nutritional properties.  Dried masa is ""masa harina"", which is what I assume you meant in the subject.

3. Corn starch is the extracted starch from the endosperm of the corn kernel.

""Corn flour"" could refer to ANY of these three things.  Finely-ground corn meal is often referred to as ""corn flour"".  Masa is often referred to as something like ""instant masa corn flour"".   And in the UK, corn starch is often referred to as ""cornflour"" (no space).

Masa is what's used in the recipes, and is what you want.  Sometimes it's hard to recognize, as ""masa"" might not always appear in the product name.  Sometimes you have to look at the ingredients, for entries such as ""nixtamalized corn"", ""corn treated with lime"", or ""calcium hydroxide"".  If you don't see any of these things, it's probably corn meal, no masa.

Case study:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0090G5SCA/

The ""Maseca"" brand name is a clue, but not definitive proof.  Maseca is a brand name frequently found on bags of masa in grocery stores, however the 5-pound grocery store bags typically say ""instant corn masa flour"", so this product's name ""Maseca Golden Quality Azteca Milling Corn Flour"" is a little suspicious due to not actually mentioning masa.  If you look at the ingredients, though, (kind of hard to read), the main ingredient is ""white corn cooked with lime-water"" which confirms it as masa.  I bought one of these 50-pound bags for $17 (with free 2-day Prime shipping) last year, so I can confirm it was good stuff.  Due to the bulk size, it has some preservatives not found in the grocery store bags, but if you can find it at a good price that's fine.

If you live in an area where it's stocked at grocery stores (such as an area with a large Hispanic population), it's almost always cheaper to buy masa in-store rather than online.  In the US, in general you should pay about $3 for 5 pounds.  I don't know what the situation is like in Canada, though.

The product you linked to is almost certainly corn meal.  Mainly it's the lack of any relevant clue words:  masa, nixtamalization, nixtamalized, lime, lime-water, calcium hydroxide, treated, cooked, etc.  The 0% calcium is also a red flag: even though masa is washed after soaking in calcium hydroxide, it still retains some calcium (with the specific amount varying from product to product).",11,t1_cnuylql,throwaway234f32423df,0,11,1421767299,t5_2wmas,0,soylent

If you fall into this relationship pattern, you're likely a white knight-a person who tends to seek out partners who need rescuing. White knights hope to receive admiration, validation, or love from their partners, but ultimately end up cheating themselves out of emotionally healthy relationships.

https://www.amazon.com/Gandhi-Autobiography-Story-Experiments-Truth/dp/0807059099,,Gandhi: An Autobiography - The Story of My Experiments With Truth,"&gt;Yeah, he wasn't always successful at abstaining.

He had an extraordinary and extreme complex about lust. He was a product of both Victorian-era Hindu and British prudishness and did not want to get married, but his parents forced him to when he was 13. When he discovered sex for the first time, with his wife, his ascetic inclinations got pushed to the wayside and he reveled in it as any teen would. Then his father got sick and was slowly dying in the hospital. Gandhi would visit him every day, but as he had just been married, wouldn't spend much time at the hospital because, as he himself wrote, he wanted to run home and have sex with his wife. His father ended up dying one night shortly after Gandhi left to go home and have sex. He developed a massive amount of guilt, feeling that he had failed in his duty as a son by letting his father die alone because of his lust. At the same time, his pregnant wife miscarried, which Gandhi saw as punishment for his immorality. After that he entrenched himself firmly in asceticism, and developed an Augustine- level hatred of lust and desired to conquer it in accordance with the teachings of the ascetic strain of Hinduism. His own wife reported that he would become physically disgusted by the act of sex. He eventually took a vow of celibacy.

Later on, around the time his wife died, he began testing himself in these extreme, ascetic ways by asking young women to sleep next to him to prove to himself that he had conquered lust completely and wouldn't even be mildly tempted by desire for them. It was absolutely inappropriate in several ways and obviously indefensible, but it's also important to note (contrary to the accusations of certain partisan groups) that he never had sex with them, according to their own testimony and that of others (his entire entourage, male and female, slept in the same room, partially because he wanted to be absolutely sure they were all celibate, too.) He never even touched them. 

Furthermore, this wasn't some secret that was uncovered after investigative work. All the people closest to him knew about it, including other political leaders in the independence movement, most of whom disapproved and publicly criticized it. Eventually, it became public knowledge, and some of the publishers of his works resigned because they didn't want to print his writings advocating these sleeping arrangement experiments. Gandhi himself still wrote publicly about it and defended the practice, but eventually, in 1947, he bowed to pressure and stopped doing it. 

EDIT: Several people have understandably asked for sources. Pretty much every major biography of Gandhi has at least some of this information in it, including his own autobiography. Try:

He was flown to hospital and spent a fair amount of time recovering from a very serious brain injury (as in, *not sure if he'll ever wake up from this coma* serious).  [[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hammond#Vampire_dragster_crash) article].  Obviously, he recovered and TG gave him a huge welcome back in s09eo1, where they also showed footage of the accident [[torrents](http://kickass.so/usearch/top%20gear%20s09e01/) of episode].

Trust me. 

Test a patch of on your inner thigh first to make sure it doesn't irritate your skin. 

I normally clean things up a bit with a trimmer and then mix equal parts Magic Shave with water in a small Tupperware container. Then I slather it all over my shaft/ balls/ taint/ all the way up my butt crack. Let it sit for 4 1/2 minutes and then jump in the shower with a wash cloth. The hairs will wipe right off.

The oldest source I could find was here (see reply dated 1/28/08): https://groups.google.com/d/msg/endoxa/fgWxP_F9RtI/Kk3mgAzzZSYJ

(edit: ** I found one earlier, see below **)

Unfortunately in regular Google search filtering by date for anything in the early 00's or late 90's returns hits against sites that clearly didn't exist back then.  Google does return a hit it *says* is from 1998 here: http://www.shadowood.uk/Store/Source/Quotes.txt, but whois says that this domain was registered in 2014.

I also checked out various IRC log sites (irclog.org and bash.org) but this phrase doesn't get any hits there (unsurprising).

I tried Google Books as well.  No hits from anything until the late 00's as well.

This is the first hit that is not attributed to Marilyn Monroe, and it's also one of the earliest hits:

https://books.google.com/books?id=fy3dqGQPljcC&amp;lpg=PT5&amp;dq=%22deserve%20me%20at%20my%20best%22&amp;pg=PT5#v=onepage&amp;q=%22deserve%20me%20at%20my%20best%22&amp;f=false

... This does occur after the Google Groups posting (copyright 7/31/08), so I suspect it's probably an appropriation of the quote.

This poster seems to think it's been around since at least 2002:

http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/106vkh/to_all_the_girls_who_misquote_marilyn_monroe/c6b2n74

I sadly haven't been able to find any evidence though.

Edit: I found a hit on amazon:

http://www.amazon.com/reader/0439918545?_encoding=UTF8&amp;query=deserves%20me#reader_0439918545

Copyright 9/1/2007.  Also mentions myspace, so it was probably common there.

Edit 2: here's an archived geocities page with lots of Marilyn Monroe quotes, and this phrase doesn't appear there (I would expect to find it there, if anywhere at all):

http://www.reocities.com/Hollywood/Boulevard/1993/quotes.html

Page was last edited on 1/10/99 (according to the footer).  Maybe our misattributed quote was created after that?

I *think* the geocities archives might be a decent way of moving up the date of first seeing this quote.  Quote pages on geocities were apparently fairly common, and I didn't see any hits there.",15,t1_co5i0hq,cheesegoat,0,15,1422599010,t5_2qh1i,0,AskReddit
https://www.amazon.com/Over-Edge-Death-Grand-Canyon/dp/097009731X,,Over the Edge:  Death in Grand Canyon,"    -People are missing or found near creeks, rivers 
of course they are, thats where people go when they are lost. they think it will lead them out of the forest. (it doesn't)

    -There is a geographical clustering of disappearances 

    -Bad weather usually occurs just as the search party gets under way 
What? This doesn't make any sense. to be able to make a claim like that, you have to analyze thousands of NPS records to find a correlation between weather and searches. Also most searches take place right after someone went missing, which is probably also connected to the weather. 

    -Swamps and briar patches play a role in the disappearances 
Do you know how easy it is to get lost in a swamp? 

    -Many disappearances occur in the late afternoon 
Late afternoon is the time when people are usually expected back from outings, if they left in the morning. They may have disappeared earlier, but are not reported until later. 
  
      -If a person is later found, they usually are unable or unwilling to remember what happened to them. 
    
PTSD. Simple as that. 

    -The missing are often found in places that were previously searched 
The people doing the searches are not usually well trained parks staff, but locals and volunteers. Also, most bodies are found years later when someone stumbles on the body accidentally.  
  
      -Berries are somehow related to the disappearances. 
that is so vague I honestly don't know where to start. ""he ate berries."" ""there were berries on the trail."" ""they had a blueberry pie yesterday."" you claim pretty much anything is related to the disappearances if you try hard enough.

I'd add all the ingredients including the liquids to the slow cooker early in the day and let that all stew for x-hours.

I would add the cooked rice to the slow cooker and mix it well and then I'd turn the heat setting up to high and remove the lid for at least an hour. 

This would allow for any excess liquids to be easily absorbed by the rice and/or evaporate. This would also concentrate the flavors (so go easy on the salt until the dish is finished cooking) and would help to avoid over cooking the rice while still allowing the rice to develop a nice crust at the bottom of the slow cooker.

Hey there,

Go ahead and cross post this to /r/askanthropology because they will have the experts you need.

Second, consider explaining why you've asked this question, because there may be some more interesting factoids if you expand your range of time a little bit. Both 1000BCE and 1000CE fall within the Late Holocene (1500BCE-1775CE). 

The Northern Pacific cultures we are familiar with today (thanks Franz Boas!) were well on track by 6,000 years ago. By 1800BCE there were already simple ranked societies (as a cultural anthropologist I tend to buck the archaeological terminology such as 'simple' but I'll do my best to repeat what the textbooks tell you). Essentially because food resources like salmon were extremely seasonal, society stratified into hierarchy by necessity in order to create effective food storage and dispersion over the year. 

Following 1800BCE, ranking became continually more elaborate. Households tended to be matrilineal (organized around ties to one's mother, her mother, etc) although social units were headed by men. Farther south (which I believe includes Oregon in the context of my reading) there were some episodes of patrilineal households and ranked polygamy, but generally these systems were more unstable. Boom and bust. Again, I'm no expert, but ~~I'll have to disagree with wildfire's comment below and say that you'll probably see planked cedar houses and possibly totem poles as early as 1000BCE. Their prevalence and elaboration is another matter~~(yeah, nope). On a side note, the issue with this whole area/time period is that sea levels rose dramatically and most likely destroyed the vast majority of available evidence, leaving archaeologists with shell middens and  the houses of weirdos that built far away from shore. 

To more directly answer your question: The more evidence you see for ranking and heirarchy, the later you probably are. One smoking gun might be the creation of burial mounds. A few of these were undertaken in the area around 1000CE, but there were none before that as far as we know. Burial mounds are large heaps of earth. It's unlikely you would catch anyone in the act of making them (they're actually quite fast to make) but you might see signs of a large mass of disturbed earth that doesn't match the geological terrain. However, I think you would be lucky to run into one because my impression is that they were quite rare. Better to just make some friends and watch for signs of heightened hierarchy (some people have more free time, specialization, accumulation of wealth, competition between groups).

Again, try cross posting to askanthrpology because you'll be much more likely to get an expert on those date ranges in that subreddit.

Thanks!

Edit 2: Putting the moderator note on top...

Edit 3: /u/retarredroof gives a great critique of what I've said here (see below). In particular I want to draw attention to a possibly much more foolproof means of answering the question which they point out. Technology is always the archaeologists go-to, and leave it to a cultural anth guy to totally overlook this in favor of nebulous social relationships which there is less evidence for:

&gt;The main difference I would anticipate between 3000 years ago and 1000 years ago on the Oregon coast would be the increased use of the specialized technologies for salmon and other anadromous species (e.g. salmon dams, fish nets, fish and lamprey traps, composite harpoons) and the onset and/or adoption of the classic NW Coast village with the use of large coastal towns by 1000 years ago. Lyman sees a transition from pit houses, like those that persist in interior Oregon until contact, to plank houses during the period of interest on the coast. Social stratification increases through time and it would not surprise me if slavery was in use by 1000 years ago. Also during this period there is a slow transition from flaked stone technology to ground stone use for harpoon and other points.",247,t1_cnml2jb,theCardiffGiant,0,247,1421081335,t5_2ssp3,0,AskHistorians

Henri Pirenne argued that the Roman world ended and the middle ages began when the long-distance trade networks that crossed the Mediterranean were broken by Muslim conquests and piracy. He published part of this argument in the 1920s, and the rest was published after his death in the 30s. Even at the time, he received a lot of criticism for overlooking important data, and his arguments have since been almost entirely disproven (Muslims were big traders, and didn't end Mediterranean trade - to note one of many possible critiques). Nevertheless, his model has proven incredibly influential, and most medieval scholars have been shaped by his ideas. Especially the idea that the medieval world focused more on local trade, agricultural economies, and self sufficiency (as opposed to the commercial economies of the Roman and modern worlds).

But since the 1930s, archaeologists have found more and more evidence that medieval people traded a lot. At first, the evidence was just for high-status objects, the kind of trade that might have only affected the elites. It was suggested that this trade might not have been an actual economic system for ordinary people - they were mostly self-sufficient, while only elites engaged in large-scale networks of exchange.

But in the past decade and a half, a ton of new evidence (much of it from private metal detector finds, which are in some countries now being recorded in national databases, like the UK [Portable Antiquities Scheme](http://finds.org.uk/)) has started to surface which suggests that, even during the early middle ages when people thought ordinary people's communities were very isolated, there appear to have been complex networks of supply and exchange that tied pretty much everyone into the trade economies that we once thought were only being used by the elite. See, for example, [this volume](http://www.amazon.com/Markets-Early-Medieval-Europe-Productive/dp/0953863077).

While none of this trade is as extensive as what we have today, there was a lot of movement around the early medieval world. Craftsmen moved, materials moved, finished goods moved, and local villages like West Heslerton in Yorkshire, which can't have had more than a few hundred inhabitants (and probably not even that), were importing fish from the ocean (20 miles away) and exporting cattle.

The medieval world was very localized, and most people were farmers, but people traded.",13,t1_cnx7r3m,alriclofgar,0,13,1421939334,t5_2ssp3,0,AskHistorians

[Here are my recommendations for a starter kit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/2p3u7i/my_recommendations_for_a_solid_starter_kit/). Note that you should use a true lather (made with a shaving brush and a shaving soap or shaving cream) instead of canned foam:

Worst: cartridge razor + canned foam    
Better: DE razor + canned foam     
Better yet: cartridge razor + true lather    
Best: DE razor + true lather 

When you start, take care to avoid [the four most common mistakes cartridge shavers make](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/15eqbh/my_so_got_me_a_starter_kit/c7lz76u) when switching to a DE razor. 

For acne, I recommend:

a. Check the ingredients in your shaving products and know which to avoid---menthol, for example, is not a good idea. Until your acne's in remission, favor unscented shaving creams and soaps.

b. Use a high-glycerin soap such as Whole Foods 365 glycerin soap with vitamin E (that's one of several glycerin soaps they offer), $2/bar, as a pre-shave beard wash. Wash beard at the sink using your hands, then rinse partially with a splash and apply lather.

c. Rinse razor head in high-proof rubbing alcohol before and after each shave.

d. After the final rinse ending the shave, glide a dry alum block over your wet skin, then set block aside and clean up around the sink, put stuff away, etc., with the alum on your face. After a minute or two, rinse the alum off, dry, and do your usual aftershave. This step is particularly helpful: alum is a mild antiseptic. You may need to wet the block in colder climes during the winter, when indoor relatively humidity plummets.

e. Use a fresh towel for every shave. You can buy thin, 100% cotton, lint-free towels called ""barber towels"" or ""bar towels"" for under $20/dozen. They're easy to launder and a fresh one for each shave helps a lot. [Here's an example](http://www.amazon.com/PARTEX-Barber-Towel-100-Cotton/dp/B0018C0LVW). You can also use surgical towels, [like these](http://www.amazon.com/Towels-Doctor-Joe-Surgical-Towel/dp/B003YCEMUA/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1375681799&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=hospital+towels). Also, [these towels from Ikea](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50215084/) are said to be good. A wet towel is a microbe incubator. 

f. Shave daily. Use very light pressure Think of your skin as being badly sunburned and the razor is an uncomfortably hot bar, but the razor still must touch the skin---but *barely*. That kind of light pressure. Daily shaving probably helps by being exfoliating and by the daily alum block and good aftershave---try one of the [Thayers witch hazels with aloe vera](http://www.thayers.com/store/?main_page=index&amp;cPath=3) or one of the witch-hazel-based aftershaves by [ProspectorCo.com](http://www.prospectorco.com/collections/clean-shaven) or [StirlingSoap.com](http://www.stirlingsoap.com/aftershave-splash/). Since the shave itself is exfoliating, I suggest restricting exfoliating scrubs to the forehead and nose and not use them where you shave---this is to minimize skin damage.

https://www.amazon.com/Vorrh-Brian-Catling/dp/0957142714,,The Vorrh,"Moore was part of the Harvey Pekar kickstarter (so his appreciation of Harvey Pekar is obvious). In a video chat, he mentioned being impressed with Craig Thompson's work. 

It is well-known that Moore is close to and is a fan of Michael Moorcock's work, and he has called out Grant Morrison for copying aspects of Moorcock's concepts wholesale.

He has written the introduction to Brian Katling's fantasy novel The Vorrh, calling it ""a phosphorescent masterpiece of fantasy"", and even makes a reference to it in LOEG: Century. 

http://www.amazon.com/The-Vorrh-Brian-Catling/dp/0957142714

Moore and Neil Gaiman are really close, and they are mutual admirers of each other's work. 

He has mentioned Garth Ennis as ""a friend"" in recent interviews.
http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/18/alan-moore-takes-cult-horror-comic-crossed-future

He has written introductions to Mike Mignola's Hellboy, Bryan Talbot's Luther Arkwright, and Planetary by Warren Ellis. (However, he also wrote the intro to The Dark Knight Returns, and we all know what he thinks of Frank Miller at the moment.)

I would venture forth to say that Moore respects any writer who is coming up with original, good work, but is dismissive of the superhero crowd who do monthlies for DC/Marvel, against which he bears a lot of ill-will.",17,t1_cnjq7sj,b34t,0,17,1420830014,t5_2syje,0,AlanMoore

This should not be too outlandish a claim, as even Christians can probably agree that most of the worlds religions are creations of our changing society (after all, Christians probably would disagree that Hinduism, paganism, Nordic, Hellenistic, aboriginal religions were divinely inspired/authored).

By looking back into the origins of Christianity, and the origins of the Judaic system from which it is derived, we can very clearly see changes in religious deities and stories, as the religion began incorporating myths from surrounding areas and as general patterns of beliefs changed. From what we can currently understand, it appears the the origin of Christianity started as a polytheistic pantheon with at least Yahweh, El, Baal and Asherah. It then moved slowly from polytheism to henotheism to monaltry to monotheism, as was relatively common in the Axial Age.

All of this points to the religion not representative of singular divine inspiration, and instead being representative of being a product of human culture, changing along with society.

This is a rather large topic of course, and if you want further reading, I recommend:

Honestly it's now around 10/10 australian hot in here, I have got no more biscuits left and my dog has fallen asleep on my foot and it's beyond asleep (the foot and the dog to equal parts). These are very basic and I would go for either EVGA, seasonic or corsair for the psu. Optical drive you probably won't need, unless you plan to convert your VHS to dvd and then to convert them to digital you rip them with the drive (too hot to think). OS you don't need to worry about, just get win8.1 64bit. Wireless adapter, because screw having a ethernet cable running through your living room, also simpler to setup.

**Edit 3:** I would get an Xbox one controller, http://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-Play-Charge-Kit-Xbox/dp/B00CMQTUY2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420187632&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=xbox+one+controller, they are an actual improvement on the X360 controllers, in my opinion, and feel more solid and well constructed. [Plus](http://imgur.com/CkIVxhv) the buttons clickity click, which could potentially make up for the lack of mechanical keyboard.

**Edit 4:** This build is cheaper and doesn't feature overclocking potential, honestly I would still go for the first build, or something similar, simply having the option of going oc later down the road, should you ever need more raw power, is earily worth the little bit you pay more

You want details? As someone who's been on propecia for 7 years, I'll give you details.

Fellow balding brothers!!!!  If you're losing your hair, but want to do something about it...I have some answers for you. I've been balding since I was 21. I'm 29 now, and still have about 85% or more of my hair. Been fighting the fight for the last 7 years.

(EDIT: People have PM'd saying ""post a CURRENT picture"", so [here you go](http://i.imgur.com/UfNQFIN.jpg). That's how I looked, as of this October. There are before/after pics at the end of this post)

""What do I do? Do I have options??"" Yes, but you really only have 1 option.....""Do 'The Big 3'"".

1: Propecia ($9 for 30 generic Proscar pills. Cut then into 1/4ths. Lasts you 120 days)

2: Rogaine (Generic rogaine from walmart costs around $30-$40 at walmart for 3 months. Less if you use liquid and it doesn't irritate your scalp)

3: Nizoral shampoo. ($15-20 from drugstore.com or walgreens.com. It should last you 2 months or so because it's not your primary shampoo)

Total monthly cost would be around $22 a month or so for ""The Big 3"", so it's not going to be a huge money sink. It will also add around 2 minutes to your daily routine, IF THAT.  It's kind of like brushing your teeth. If you want to keep them, then you have to be proactive about taking care of them.

*(and, fuck you haters that are going to accuse me of being some ""big pharma rep"". If you pay even a TINY bit of attention, you'll see that I recommend generic medications. So..ya...there's that)*

Get generic Proscar (have your doctor write you an RX). Proscar is 5mg of Finasteride (propecia is 1mg of Finasteride) used to treat BHP. Get a $3 pill cutter from walmart and cut them into quarters.  This means $9 for 120 days of propecia, whereas getting actual name brand propecia is around $70 or so a month. Tell your doctor that you can't afford name brand, and that Proscar is LITERALLY the exact same thing as Propecia, just a 5x stronger dose. Most people can be sympathetic towards wanting to save money.  Just be upfront and honest with him.  If you don't have a doctor, PLEASE DO NOT GET GENERICS ONLINE!! Pay for one doctor visit (or a dermatologist visit) and then get the RX for Proscar. You will STILL pay less overall for that than you will getting generics online.  Source? I did generics for 4 years before I wised up. I think I paid around $30-$40 a month for generics. You'll save money in the long run, so long as it's not $400+ for one doctor visit.  [Here's my latest Finasteride pack for proof that I am actually on propecia myself](http://i.imgur.com/ShSRj60.jpg).

Get generic rogaine from walmart.  Start with 1 month of the liquid and see how it works.  Only get 1 month to start because it MIGHT irritate your scalp (PPG is the delivery vehicle, and some people get really itchy where it's applied [I had a horrible itch]).  If it doesn't bother you, then after a month get the 3 month supply (I say liquid because it has a slightly better rate of growth than the foam).  If it bothers you (either because it's itchy or because it feels like it makes your hair too greasy), then get the 3 months supply of Rogaine foam.

Nizoral is hard to find these days, but what you want is a shampoo that has at least 1% KETOCONAZOLE as the active ingredient. Keto has been shown to have anti androgen properties. By itself it's not going to do much, but it helps in conjunction with the other things.

I also use Nioxin System 2 for my normal shampoos.  It SAYS it's suppose to help with thinning hair. I have my doubts, but I like the way it makes my hair feel. It's much more manageable and better looking when I use it.  It's not super cheap, but buy the liter bottles and they'll last you for at least a couple months, if not closer to 3 or 4 months.  You need to get 2 kinds, [cleanser and scalp therapy](http://www.amazon.com/Nioxin-System-Cleanser-Scalp-Therapy/dp/B000TMM2PU/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1375736033&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=nioxin+system+2+duo).  Buy them both, then just buy them  individually as needed.

Propecia: Some people say that taking propecia makes them kinda tired for the first few hours after they take the pill. I think that's kinda bogus, but I always take mine right before bed...just in case.

Rogaine: Take a shower in the morning, towel dry your hair, then put the rogaine in and let it sit while you get dressed.  After that, style your hair as usual.  Put it in again before you go to bed (needs to be in 2x a day), but do it as the FIRST thing before your nightly ritual so that it sits on your head and can be absorbed and not run down the side of your head when you're sleeping.

Nizoral/Nioxin: You want your hair to be somewhat clean from normal oils so that Nizoral will suds up and hit your scalp. I use generic T-Gel from walmart for the first round of hair washing. Rinse, then apply Nizoral.  After you do that, then start washing yourself off. Get all sudsy and clean, then rise your hair out (you do this to let the Nizoral sit and soak your scalp for a while. DON'T RINSE OFF YET!).  Next you use the Nioxin cleanser. It doesn't have to sit, so just lather up and rinse out.  Now for the Nioxin cleanser. It's basically a conditioner, so put it on and let it sit while you rinse off. You want it to sit on your head for about 2 minutes.  After that, rinse off, get out of the shower, towel dry your hair, then put on your Rogaine.

B: Don't tell me, ""The angle on the frontal picture is different, INVALID COMPARISON PICTURE!!"" I'm sorry that, 2 years later, I couldn't exactly match up the angle of my face. If you look at the hair and the density, you can see the difference.

If you're up for more motivation [Earthlings](http://earthlings.com/) is a very powerful movie which will likely cement your resolve to step out of an unnecessary system. Also Forks over Knives and Vegucated are on netflix which are much less graphic and provide lots of info.

I also like to recommend books to help people learn more about the ethics of animal consumption. [Eating Animals](http://www.amazon.com/Eating-Animals-Jonathan-Safran-Foer/dp/0316069884) is a great read from an investigative angle from a renowned novelist and [Eat Like You Care](http://www.amazon.com/Eat-Like-You-Care-Examination-ebook/dp/B00DLTN43C) is a short and very powerful case for the ethical necessity of not consuming animals.

The coffee at Korean coffee shops is super watered down...I hate it.  

Buy deodorant if you are someone who smells (I'm Korean and most Koreans don't need it).  

Beef Jerky is also something that Korean people like but is not very abundant.  

Bring a GSM-enabled phone so you can buy a SIM card.  A Smartphone is a must!!!

A pebble watch is super useful on the subways to wake you up before your stop.  Be ready for the shower an toilet to be in the same room.  

Bring some passport sized photos with you as they are necessary to get some ID cards.  There are also passport machines in some subway stations.  

Bring any medicines you might need as Korean pharmacies might not have the same stuff.  There is also that issue of medicines being labelled in Korean.  

Bring a Korean phrase book or better yet an app to translate.

LEARN HANGUL (Korean alphabet)!!!!!  I cannot emphasize this enough.  It is super easy and can be learned in 15 minutes or while on the plane ride!  Here is a useful guide: http://9gag.com/gag/3968335/learn-to-read-korean-in-15-minutes

Google maps is not very useful in Korea because there are some regulatory things.  Bing maps is suprisingly more useful than Google maps in Korea.  Once you learn Hangul, use Daum maps or Naver maps.

Download the App called Kakaotalk.  This is the primary means of communication in Korea instead of text messaging.

Learn to take taxis and not get ripped off.  Here is an article: http://www.korea4expats.com/article-taxi-korea.html

Buy these: http://www.amazon.com/Delicol-Assorted-Seamless-Bandanna-Headwrap/dp/B00IRVNH3Q/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420937004&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=head+buff

Download the app called Jihachul (Korean Subway).  It is very useful to learn the subway system.  Also while you are there, right before you board, the map different destinations might have a # on it like (3-1).  That number corresponds to the train car # that will help you walk the shortest distance.  Let's say you are going to Gangnam station, there might be a # on the map like ""5-2"" right next to Gangnam station which means if you go to that specific car, when you get off, that specific train car will be closest to the exit or transfer point.

Make friends that are American, but also Korean!  Please do not isolate yourself from experiencing Korean culture from the Korean native's eyes.  Korean friends help you learn Korean, can help buy medications at the pharmacy and even help you if you need to go to the hospital.  They are invaluable and will also appreciate speaking english with you.

You can drink in public in Korea, but please don't be flamboyant about it.

Subways are cheapest, taxis are not as cheap but still cheap (especially if you are with a group of people), and don't take the bus unless you know hangul and know what you're doing.

If you wear prescription eye glasses, bring your prescription with you.  Eye glasses are super cheap, don't buy them in the states.  They can be as low as $20-$50.

I would recommend the KT Olleh telecom company and buy the 2GB/month plan with 25 talk time minutes.  This will run you around $20-$25.  It comes with unlimited Olleh hotspot data and Olleh hotspots are in every subway car and almost everywhere in the city.

Korea is a gift giving society.  Bring gifts from the United States to your employer, friends, or anyone who helps you.  They will be in your debt and will be even more helpful in your endeavors to assimilate.  Chocolate, coffee, beef jerky, whiskey, and beer are all good gifts for the appropriate person.

Korean Beer sucks, learn to drink soju.  Drink it now before you go.  My favorite soju is Joeun Day soju.  I believe it is from Daegu.  http://www.eurohitechsystem.com.sg/content/uploads/photo/resize_1389858508.jpg

However, I totally recommend [An Unnatural Order](http://www.amazon.com/An-Unnatural-Order-Destruction-Nature/dp/1590560817) by Jim Mason as it takes an interesting look at the development of society from an anthropological perspective. 

He makes a pretty good case we were originally ""foragers"" with a focus on gathering the readily available foods (e.g. berries, plants, remains of animals killed by actual predators etc.) not ""hunter gathers"" with a focus on hunting for just about all of our development. He suggests it was only very recently we came to think of ourselves as the ""predators"" on top the food chain with dominion over all animals and previously were much more in tune with the natural world as a component requiring knowledge to forage, not a ruler for the hundreds of thousands of years of our development. 

This is all pretty obvious if you figure we've only domesticated animals and farmed for 10,000 years  and our modern homo sapiens sapiens species have existed for ~200,000 years. We tend to forget that our society as we think of it now is extremely new even for our modern species and claims to nature should probably look back more than a few thousand years.

Anyway it's all very interesting but ultimately irrelevant as we don't need to eat animals today.",11,t1_cnsimvh,Agricola86,0,11,1421553134,t5_2qhpm,0,vegan

I'm not an expert on the history of Islam in India.  Some say the Mughal Empire killed 80,000,000 Hindus through the centuries, others say that this is garbage and that the Mughals had a pretty hands-off approach toward governance, others point out that there were Muslim dynasties in India who fought against the Mughals, others talk about how Islamic rulers and their methods ranged from everything from Akhbar to Aurungazeb.  So I'm not sold either way.  

&gt;This is a clash of civilizations and the Neville Chamberlain routine against Islam has failed.

See, this is the simplistic and superficial ""Them and Us"" narrative that I cannot stand.  Radical Islam is very much a product of so-called ""Western civilization"".  

The CIA and the State Department funded radical mujahadeen in Afghanistan through the '80s, and former directors of the CIA like William Casey were Christian fundamentalists who wanted to see an alliance between Christians and Muslims against the ""godless communists"" of the USSR, and Saudi Arabia--the premier source of radical Islamic fundamentalism--has been a key regional ally of the West since World War 1 when the British helped the al-Saud family and the fundamentalist Wahabi clerics gain power over the peninsula.  Check out [*Ghost Wars*](http://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Wars-Afghanistan-Invasion-September/dp/0143034669) and [*Carbon Democracy*](http://www.amazon.com/Carbon-Democracy-Political-Power-Age/dp/1781681163) for good pieces of scholarship on all of this.    

Then when this came back and bit the US in the ass on 9/11 the government promptly invaded and occupied Afghanistan and then Iraq, eventually extending the war--undeclared and covert--into Pakistan, Yemen, Syria, and Somalia.  Hardly a ""Neville Chamberlain"" routine.  

And even after all this, the US government [thought it was a good idea to turn around and once again start arming radical Sunni militants](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/03/05/the-redirection), in order to destabilize and counterbalance Iranian influence in Syria and Lebanon, and increase the influence of the Gulf States (which themselves are the primary source of funding for terrorist activity).  

But hey I guess this is all too complicated for some people so I guess we should just stick with a black-and-white fairy tale about Good and Evil so our heads don't hurt too much, right?        ",16,t1_co2dxdd,arjun10,0,16,1422370794,t5_2sfmf,0,PoliticalDiscussion
https://www.amazon.com/Historicity-Jesus-Might-Reason-Doubt/dp/1909697494,,On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might Have Reason for Doubt,"&gt; Redditepsilon, 2 day old account.  While a very young account is usually indicative of some sort of got'ca or make-a-claim hit and run account -  Redditepsilon, your post history provides some evidence that you will actually discuss/debate against your topic post, so some short answers (mostly copy and paste from previous debates) to these common claims.

&gt; If we look at the background historical data on the resurrection of Jesus, which is the empty tomb,

Let's look at what is arguably the most important narrative related to Jesus in Christianity, the Resurrection narratives. Ignoring the [completely inaccurate portrayal of the Roman trial law and procedures in the Trial of Jesus](http://www.shroud.com/bucklin2.htm), and the historically unsupportable removal of the body of the decessed Jesus from the crufix and tomb burial - which presumes that the body was actually placed in the tomb ([link - warning a HUGH wall of text](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/21whj7/if_jesus_didnt_rise_from_the_dead_what_really/cghitz4)), let's look at the consistency and accuracy of the various canon Gospel narratives related to the resurrection. The much studied, and selected, Gospel canon narratives, canon selected by learned men who had both (1) strong motivation to select narratives that supported their worldview and confirmation bias and (2) demonstrated rejection of dogma/narratives that did not fit their self-selected criteria, results in a series of Resurrection narratives that are highly non-internally consistent. 

* [Comparison Chart: Biblical Accounts of the Resurrection](http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/charts/resurrection_accounts.htm)
* [A Table Comparing the Contents of the Resurrection Narratives in each of the Four Gospels](http://homepage.ntlworld.com/rsposse/rescomptable.htm)

Before the Christian Apologist kicks in and claims that these narratives are all essentially the same (somehow), consider the narratives from the claim that there is a truth position in Christianity/Yahweh's existence that results from the argument of internal consistency and historical fact. Given the widely different versions of the Resurrection narrative, for what is arguably the most important and essential event/tenet of Christianity, the argument from internal consistency of it's own *historical* fact fails to be credible.  

&gt; the post-mortem apparances of Jesus to different people and groups of people

Besides the claim of the apostles that they saw Jesus post-resurrection, who were these other people?

&gt; the origin of the disciples faith that Jesus rose from the dead 

But speaking of the appearance of post-resurrection Jesus - Jesus purposefully provided empirical physical, and falsifiable, evidence that he (Jesus) was alive and in natural physical human body form (Doubting Thomas, John 20:24-29) following the Resurrection. 1. Why does Jesus fail to provide such evidence now? and 2. In light of the actions of Jesus, why is Religious Faith considered such a virtue?

&gt; the willingness of Jesus' disciples to go to their deaths for that faith

[Fallacy of argumentum ad martyrium \(argument from martyrdom](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_martyrdom)). While the argument from martyrdom, an appeal to emotion, produces an emotional response, the act of martyrdom/suicide in no way provides, or supports, a truth position against the belief that is used to support the label of martyr. People voluntarily die for all sorts of beliefs that have no truth value.

For a detailed assessment see: [March to Martyrdom! \(Down the Yellow Brick Road…\)](https://adversusapologetica.wordpress.com/2012/12/18/48/)

&gt;  is that a convincing evidence on a balance of probability, that Jesus was raised from the dead?

No.  The claim/assertions of resurrection is, at best, highly questionable.

&gt; And doesn't that suggest he was raised by God from the dead?

Again no.

&gt; it's almost certain he [Jesus] existed.

Did Jesus the man exist as depicted in the New Testament of the Bible?

Given the contradictions internally within in the narratives and the contradictions in events/dates between the narratives and events/dates presented in contemporary histories, I would say that it is unlikely that, presuming existence of a historical figure, the depiction of Jesus the man in the Gospels is accurate.

I will concede that there was a man, a Jewish man, that acted as a Rabbi, and that preached a form of divergent Judaism, and that lived around 4 BCE'ish till around 29 BCE'ish (when this man is said to have died). I concede that a historical Jesus existed, where Jesus is the name given to the archetype of the person upon which the Jesus narrative in the New Testament is based. Yĕhōšuă‘, Joshua, Jesus, יְהוֹשֻׁעַ, was not an uncommon name within the Hebrew community and may represent the actual name of this archetypal person. This Jesus character is also attributed with what can arguably be described as a lite version of the morality of Buddhism, and this Jesus was a decent, though with a rather shallow philosophy, fellow. This Jesus was also atypical of the contemporary Jews as he was in his 30's and had not married.

The Divine narrative attributed to the Jesus character, however, is a different issue.

* [On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might Have Reason for Doubt](http://www.amazon.com/Historicity-Jesus-Might-Reason-Doubt/dp/1909697494/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1409253863&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=On+the+Historicity+of+Jesus%3A+Why+We+Might+Have+Reason+for+Doubt) by Richard Carrier

Summary: The assumption that Jesus existed as a historical person has occasionally been questioned in the course of the last hundred years or so, but any doubts that have been raised have usually been put to rest in favor of imagining a blend of the historical, the mythical and the theological in the surviving records of Jesus. Carrier re-examines the whole question and finds compelling reasons to suspect the more daring assumption is correct. He lays out extensive research on the evidence for Jesus and the origins of Christianity and poses the key questions that must now be answered if the historicity of Jesus is to survive as a dominant paradigm. Carrier contrasts the most credible reconstruction of a historical Jesus with the most credible theory of Christian origins if a historical Jesus did not exist. Such a theory would posit that the Jesus figure was originally conceived of as a celestial being known only through private revelations and hidden messages in scripture; then stories placing this being in earth history were crafted to communicate the claims of the gospel allegorically; such stories eventually came to be believed or promoted in the struggle for control of the Christian churches that survived the tribulations of the first century. Carrier finds the latter theory more credible than has been previously imagined. He explains why it offers a better explanation for all the disparate evidence surviving from the first two centuries of the Christian era. He argues that we need a more careful and robust theory of cultural syncretism between Jewish theology and politics of the second-temple period and the most popular features of pagan religion and philosophy of the time. For anyone intent on defending a historical Jesus, this is the book to challenge.

OP, if you wish to have a more indepth discussion/debate, a suggestion...  Pick just one claim/assertion, start a new topic (here in /r/debateanatheist or /r/DebateReligion), present your claim and supporting argument/position, and then defend that claim and argument.  When you post as many claims as you did in this topic post (and presented without actual credible evidence or supporting argument), the length of a full and detailed response becomes silly.

EDIT:  Going back to the empty tomb argument....

OP, [here are some previous discussions concerning the claims made around the empty tomb](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicBiblical/search?q=empty+tomb&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) that came up in /r/AcademicBiblical.  

/r/AcademicBiblical is a fairly active subreddit that discusses early Judaism and Christianity—with a focus on Biblical texts, but also related noncanonical literature (1 Enoch, the Dead Sea Scrolls, etc.)—in a ***scholarly context***.  A highly recommended subreddit for all those interested in studies of Judaism and Christianity. ",14,t1_cnoet4z,TooManyInLitter,0,14,1421211922,t5_2ryfy,0,DebateAnAtheist
https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Calculus-Differential-Forms-Approach/dp/0817637079,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41J-k7uTWtL._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg",Advanced Calculus: A Differential Forms Approach,"i have three categories of suggestions.

**advanced calculus**

these are essentially precursors to smooth manifold theory. you mention you have had calculus 3, but this is likely the modern multivariate calculus course.

* [advanced calculus: a differential forms approach by harold edwards](http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Calculus-Differential-Forms-Approach/dp/0817637079)

* [advanced calculus: a geometric view by james callahan](http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Calculus-Geometric-Undergraduate-Mathematics/dp/1441973311)

* [vector calculus, linear algebra, and differential forms: a unified approach by john hubbard](http://www.amazon.com/Vector-Calculus-Linear-Algebra-Differential/dp/B008VRPQV2)

out of these, if you were to choose one, i think the callahan book is probably your best bet to pull from. it is the most modern, in both approach and notation. it is a perfect setup for smooth manifolds (however, all of these books fit that bill). hubbard's book is very similar, but i don't particularly like its notation. however, it has some unique features and does attempt to unify the concepts, which is a nice approach. edwards book is just fantastic, albeit a bit nonstandard. at a minimum, i recommend reading the first three chapters and then the latter chapters and appendices, in particular chapter 8 on applications. the first three chapters cover the core material, where chapters 4-6 then go on to solidify the concepts presented in the first three chapters a bit more rigorously.

**smooth manifolds**

* [an introduction to manifolds by loring tu](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Manifolds-Universitext-Loring-W/dp/1441973990)

* [introduction to smooth manifolds by john m. lee](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Smooth-Manifolds-Graduate-Mathematics/dp/1441999817)

* [manifolds and differential geometry by jeffrey m. lee](http://www.amazon.com/Manifolds-Differential-Geometry-Graduate-Mathematics/dp/0821848151)

* [first steps in differential geometry: riemannian, contact, sympletic by andrew mcinerney](http://www.amazon.com/First-Steps-Differential-Geometry-Undergraduate/dp/146147731X/)

out of these books, i only have explicit experience with the first two. i learned the material in graduate school from john m. lee's book, which i later solidifed by reading tu's book. tu's book actually covers the same core material as lee's book, but what makes it more approachable is that it doesn't emphasize, and thus doesn't require a lot of background in, the topological aspects of manifolds. it also does a better job of showing examples and techniques, and is better written in general than john m. lee's book. although, john m. lee's book is rather good.

so out of these, i would no doubt choose tu's book. i mention the latter two only to mention them because i know about them. i don't have any experience with them.

**conceptual books**

these books should be helpful as side notes to this material.

* [div, grad, curl are dead by william burke [pdf]](http://people.ucsc.edu/~rmont/papers/Burke_DivGradCurl.pdf)

* [geometrical vectors by gabriel weinreich](http://www.amazon.com/Geometrical-Vectors-Chicago-Lectures-Physics/dp/0226890481)

* [about vectors by banesh hoffmann](http://www.amazon.com/About-Vectors-Dover-Books-Mathematics/dp/0486604896/)

i highly recommend all of these because they're all rather short and easy reads. the first two get at the visual concepts and intuition behind vectors, covectors, etc. they are actually the only two out of all of these books (if i remember right) that even talk about and mention twisted forms.

there are also a ton of books for physicists, applied differential geometry by william burke, gauge fields, knots and gravity by john baez and javier muniain (despite its title, it's very approachable), variational principles of mechanics by cornelius lanczos, etc. that would all help with understanding the intuition and applications of this material.

**conclusion**

if you're really wanting to get right to the smooth manifolds material, i would start with tu's book and then supplement as needed from the callahan and hubbard books to pick up things like the implicit and inverse function theorems. i highly recommend reading edwards' book regardless. if you're long-gaming it, then i'd probably start with callahan's book, then move to tu's book, all the while reading edwards' book. :)

i have been out of graduate school for a few years now, leaving before finishing my ph.d. i am actually going back through callahan's book (didn't know about it at the time and/or it wasn't released) for fun and its solid expositions and approach. edwards' book remains one of my favorite books (not just math) to just pick up and read.",13,t1_cndp9es,nikofeyn,0,13,1420338708,t5_2qh0n,0,math

It took me forever to realize, but I wasn't the best man to my wife. Looking back, I can clearly see how I wasn't keeping her satisfied in general; I wasn't meeting her needs so we grew apart. I worked hard, she worked hard, and things have gotten so much better, better than ever.

Find out what her love language is and show her you care by doing those things. Does she enjoy acts of service? Cook dinner, do laundry, vacuum, dust, make the bed, etc. Does she enjoy gifts? Surprise her with a new book, a necklace, a sweater, just because. Does she want physical touch? Hold her tight, caress her, keep her toes warm on cold nights.

Relationships aren't easy and they aren't a given. They require work but that work is worth it when you both come out happy.

https://www.amazon.com/Odd-Girl-Out-Revised-Updated/dp/0547520190,,"Odd Girl Out, Revised and Updated: The Hidden Culture of Aggression in Girls","Dunno how it got started, but it's kept alive by the difference in how girls and boys deal tend to deal with conflict. Girls are encouraged to be nice to everyone. Since being assertive as a girl can be seen as bitchy especially during grade school, girls resort to more indirect methods of dealing with anger/conflict. This basically requires them to bring other girls into the conflict which can quickly make a small argument become way more serious than it needs to be. Since the original people involved will usually not resolve this directly, the fight stretches on far longer than it needs to. This is what people usually identify as ""drama"".
On the other hand boys are generally encouraged to be assertive and/or aggressive. While the aggressive approach isn't exactly a healthy one either it tends to end the conflict fast and is generally tolerated by others with a ""boys will be boys"" kind of attitude. Even if it gets out of hand, boys have the advantage of teachers and other staff who will intervene once the conflict gets too physical. There is usually no such intervention in girls conflict as it is often invisible to teachers.

TL;DR girls are encouraged to not be assertive so conflict doesn't get resolved as quickly and tends to involve more people. At this point people start calling it ""drama"".

At this point the less bright intern turned to the other and said, ""you're an idiot, they'll just go at the same time. Dumbass.""

He chose you for a reason, and you sound like a responsible person - for starters you're already researching and asking people for advice. That's very admirable.

https://www.amazon.com/Yeast-Practical-Fermentation-Brewing-Elements/dp/0937381969,,Yeast: The Practical Guide to Beer Fermentation (Brewing Elements),"World-class mead can be made in 3 months time.  Almost every one of our meads at Schramm's are made within 3 months, and bottled in the 4th month (with the exception of our dry melomel 'Blackberry Sec' - this one gets an additional ML fermentation - and our cyser 'Apple' - this one is made by not pitching any yeast or nutrients at all, and ferments spontaneously over the course of 9-10 months).  The highest-rated mead in the world is made in plastic primary fermentation buckets for a month (at ambient temperatures), followed by a month in secondary on glass, followed by another month in tertiary on glass.  So I know it can be done by you, at home, without special equipment.

My best suggestion for you would be to understand your yeast: for a standard strength mead use 71B-1122 (low nitrogen requirement), ferment in the range of 61-65 deg F, rehydrate your yeast using Go-Ferm, and use nutrient additions of Fermaid-K (or Fermdaid-O) and DAP (diammonium phosphate) in proper amounts for the first 4 days after lag (as detailed in the [January/February issue of Zymurgy](http://www.homebrewersassociation.org/magazine/search-zymurgy-issues/)).  If you don't use fruit or root-spices, then you should look into adding something to buffer the rather rapid change in pH that occurs during fermentation, and potassium carbonate or potassium bicarbonate can do the trick for you here, too.  This provides a source of nutrient as well as a pH buffer (something that honey lacks, unlike beer wort or grape wine musts).  Above all, study, study, study and remember this axiom: quality in, quality out.  You will get better, faster results with quality ingredients.  There are a lot of [free articles available online](https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/attachments/0000/1256/NDzym05_MasterMead.pdf) but there are also some great books out there that will help you understand yeast health and nutrition.  I recommend the book ['Yeast' by Chris White and Jamil Zainasheff](http://www.amazon.com/Yeast-Practical-Fermentation-Brewing-Elements/dp/0937381969), and there are some other mead-centric books I can point you to.

https://www.amazon.com/Divided-Soul-Life-Marvin-Gaye/dp/030681191X,,Divided Soul: The Life Of Marvin Gaye,"A lot of times the story behind the albums make them better. My personal favorite is Marvin Gaye's 1978 album [*Here, My Dear.*](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dE5T-zoXeBc/UE_BjGMkdAI/AAAAAAAAAO8/DPy5t6_ApJ4/s1600/3+Marvin+Gaye+Here+My+Dear+GF+Front+Back.JPG) When I first heard this album I thought it was just okay, and just a little too long. Then I read his biography [Divided Soul](http://www.amazon.com/Divided-Soul-Life-Marvin-Gaye/dp/030681191X/) and learned that this album was actually used to pay his ex-wife after their divorce, I had to go listen to it again.


As part of their divorce, the album's profits would go to her. Marvin was just coming off a hit single, [Got to Give It Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75BlzjqGVcc), his first hit in a few years. So instead of making a disco dance pop record that would most likely be a hit, he makes *Here, My Dear.* The title just reeks of bitter sarcasm. Mind you, his ex-wife is Berry (the founder of his label, Motown Records) Gordy's sister, who was 17 years older than him. And the album is just chock full of slight jabs and straight uppercuts. After reading the book, knowing their history, and his life up to this point, no album of his is as personal and carries such weight. So going in and listening to the album again, the lyrics resonate much deeper. I also started noticing the production of the album, which Marvin Gaye produced himself, and took notice of all the nuances and subtleties in it. [Is That Enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgHcniBuHA) is everything perfect within the album. The personal and biting lyrics, along with the fantastic production where instruments just creep in and out across the whole thing. Not to mention, it's just smooth and syrupy as fuck.


In 1978 the album was critically panned and a commercial flop. Over the years, it's grown to become a classic. And that's due to Marvin's tragic story. In this case, the story+time made people appreciate something that was easily dismissed when originally released. Everybody knows of Marvin Gaye, but not many *Here, My Dear* and the story behind it. If you're a fan of his, reading *Divided Soul* is a necessity. ",33,t1_cnmyqhm,WhatWouldSpaderDo,0,33,1421104515,t5_2t4it,0,LetsTalkMusic

Favorites I've read so far:

* [Inside the Black Box](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470432063/) (if you're totally new to the concept)

* [Quantitative Trading](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470284889) (the second book, Algorithmic trading goes deeper into implementing strategies, also good)

* [Trading Systems](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1905641796/) (a GREAT book on implementation and the process of testing a strategy)

* [Active Portfolio Management](http://www.amazon.com/Active-Portfolio-Management-Quantitative-Controlling/dp/0070248826/) (Kind of a classic, more theory than implementation, requires some fundamental understanding of MPT, CAPM and related concepts. Good chapter on multi-factor risk models)

Also

* [Algorithmic Trading and DMA](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0956399207/) (Still on my bookshelf, haven't gotten around to reading it yet, but it's supposed to be *the* book on market microstructure, so if you'er interested in HFT or level-2 algos, this is a good starting point)

Edit: Be prepared to spend about 3 months just randomly browsing [Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com) to crack through all the jargon :)

Also, these guys have some pretty rockin' videos on on everything finance, from ""WTF is an ETF?"" to ""WTF is a European Call Option?"" to ""How do I manage my pension?"", especially useful if you're in the UK. The videos helped me a lot when I was getting started at my current job.

Some cats can handle losing a prior caretaker/companion and changes in their homes/territory, but many just cannot handle it well and get super stressed.  With stress comes hiding, meowing, and peeing/marking.  I am certain as well that your other cat is also hiding from some stress of the new cat too, though likely not as much, because at least their territory has their scent in it.

I would recommend a few things.  Look into NurtureCalm pheromone collars and also Feliway spray and diffusers.  The diffusers are plug-ins and will diffuse the pheromones all day long.  The spray can be used to specifically spray in high stress areas or where the cats are peeing/marking or fighting/meowing.  I also use [an essential oil diffuser](http://www.amazon.com/Stadler-Form-JASMINE-Aroma-Diffuser/dp/B0065R2AGO) and add calming/anti-stress oils to it, and sometimes even spray some Feliway into the water to be diffused as well.

Make sure you also have at least two litter boxes (and from what I read, one extra if you can do it).  Make sure the litter boxes are large enough (the dome ones are rated the worst) and I would suggest non-lidded, as most cats don't like the lids, and they are more for humans.  And make sure the litter is not too hard or too pellet-like, as most cats prefer sandier/finer grained litter.  I personally will only use Scoop Away.  

Hopefully some of this will help you.  Once you bring down the stress and can make sure the litter/litter boxes are not a factor, you may also want to make sure there's a lot of toys for the cats to play with when you are at work or away from the apartment.  And a good, tall cat tree by a window is always a good thing.

The lengthy compositor’s error, if such it may be called, occurs in the book of Ezekiel, chapter 48, verse five:   

2. And bye the border of Dan, fromme the east side to the west side, a portion for Afher.   
3. And bye the border of Afhter, fromme the east side even untoe the west side, a portion for Naphtali.

6 And bye the border of Ephraim, from the east fide even untoe the west fide, a portion for Reuben.   

[The Buggre Alle This Bible was also noteworthy for having twenty seven verses in the third chapter of Genesis, instead of the more usual twenty four.

They followed verse 24, which in the King James version reads:

“So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life,” and read:

25 And the Lord spake unto the Angel that guarded the eastern gate, saying Where is the flaming sword which was given unto thee?    
26 And the Angel said, I had it here only a moment ago, I must have put it down some where, forget my own head next.    
27 And the Lord did not ask him again.    

It appears that these verses were inserted during the proof stage. In those days it was common practice for printers to hang proof sheets to the wooden beams outside their shops, for the edification of the populace and some free proofreading, and since the whole print run was subsequently burned anyway, no one bothered to take up this matter with the nice Mr. A. Ziraphale, who ran the bookshop two doors along and was always so helpful with the translations, and whose handwriting was instantly recognizable.]

That's not problematic *in the abstract*. But when we start looking at particular *instances*, we can start to see when such things might become more problematic. Here's an example:

&gt;“Dread locks” refer to a style of hair from the Afro-Caribbean tradition that is a direct form of resistance by black people to white supremacy and white standards of beauty.  The term “dread locks” actually refers to how black folks in Caribbean nations were often referred to by the white slave owners as the “dread people” because they were seen as dreaded and lowly.  The act of “locking” one’s hair was in resistance to white standards of beauty and white oppression that told black people of the Caribbean that they were not beautiful and that they needed to wear their hair a certain way.

&gt;So why is it problematic for white people to wear their hair as “dread locks?”  Well, to understand this, it is important that we understand the concept of cultural appropriation.  It defines appropriation as, “The act of making use of without any authority or right.”  The basic idea of cultural appropriation is when a group (usually the dominant group in society, though not always) takes aspects of another person’s culture without permission and adopts it as part of its own, often without recognition to the roots and history of the cultural tradition in question.

So we have to pay close attention to the *without recognition to the roots and history of the cultural tradition in question* bit. Look at the ensuing paradoxical nature of a white ruling class individual from the Caribbean adopting a hair style whose roots were planted firmly *as an act of resistance against the ruling class*. Not only is it strange to adopt a hair style that symbolized the struggle of the disenfranchised when you yourself are a member of the ruling class, but doing so *trivializes* their grievances against you and doesn't seem to really respect the tradition as an embodiment of the struggle for human equality. 

Notice also that using elements from other cultures and blending them into something new isn't what's wrong, it's the *state of mind* with which its done. Not bothering to understand the origin of the tradition or cultural practice, merely treating cultural artifacts as mere objects to synthesize, rather than *understand*, is what it's at fault. Appropriation can be done without it being problematic, but that requires you to be a thoughtful individual who goes out of his way to understand the traditions you're attempting to bring into the fold. And the problem is that that kind of intellectual responsibility isn't something you find often. Hardly anyone bothers to stop and think whether dressing up as an Indian for Halloween might be problematic, nor would they ever give consideration to the role that dreadlocks played on the colonial history of the Caribbean. 

So it's just a matter of being a thoughtful individual and someone who incorporates elements from other traditions in a *tasteful* manner. But the knee-jerk reaction to suggestions of cultural appropriation is to outright dismiss it without ever [bothering to understand the claims being made](http://www.amazon.com/Ethics-Cultural-Appropriation-James-Young/dp/1444350838).

I enjoy it.  There's a bunch of ways, but here's some tips that I have figured out.

 * Label your cable ends (either use a label maker or [just get one of these booklets](http://www.vetco.net/catalog/images/3M-SPB-02-1.jpg)).
 * Two people make it go more than twice as fast.  Buy pizza for a friend.
 * Leave the [cable box](http://www.monoprice.com/Category?c_id=105&amp;cp_id=10234) at the source, pull cable to the destination.
 * Get a set of [fish sticks](http://www.morrisproducts.com/images/52237_l.jpg) for sending wire down/up walls.  Buy a couple of rolls of electrical tape, too, for taping wire to the fish sticks.
 * Measure to the same height as the electrical outlets in the wall for a clean look.  Get the same color [faceplates and keystone jacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_module) as the electrical system already has.
 * Make sure you use a [stud finder with AC electrical alerting](http://www.amazon.com/Zircon-59544-StudSensor-SL-AC-Sensor/dp/B0001Q2VNW/ref=sr_1_8?s=hi&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1421691686&amp;sr=1-8&amp;keywords=AC+electrical+scanning) before you cut.
 * When you are ready to cut a hole in the wall, take a [wall box eliminator](http://www.altex.com/Assets/ProductImages/MP-1.jpg), flip it backwards, and trace the inside with pencil.  Then cut with a utility knife.  I find that a dremel saves time but creates a LOT of dust, and really isn't that much easier.
 * Pull the cable (or fish stick) through until you've got a good 2-3 feet sticking out of the wall.  If you think you're EVER going to need more than one jack in this room, run it now (it is easier to buy two boxes of cable than one, and run two cables simultaneously). 
 * Put the wall box eliminator in the wall, and fold the tines back / screw the holders in (they all basically have some mechanism of ""grabbing"" the wall, to give you a hole in the wall with the two faceplate screw holes like an [electrical wall box](http://inspectapedia.com/electric/Old_Work_Electrical_Box_023_DFs.jpg) has, but without the box - which is safe because it's low voltage (don't do this for real electrical work!!!))
 * Cut off the first 6 inches or so of the cable with your [dikes](http://s1265.photobucket.com/user/bushmasterACR/media/Tekton3526DiagonalCutPliers2pb_zpse0d7ca2e.jpg.html), because it might have been fucked up being taped to a fish stick and rammed through the wall, etc.
 * Strip off the outer jacket of another 4-5 inches using your [cyclops stripping tool](http://www.comm-store.co.uk/media/images/upload/315/622.jpg).
 * Terminate into the [rj45 keystone jack](http://austline.com/Austline_eStoreWeb_Picture/1ComputersITOffice/CablesAccessories/WallPlate_Jacks/FlushWallPlate_Cat6/8009/4x1PortCat6_8009coverKeystoneWhite03.jpg) using a [punchdown tool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_down_tool).  
 * Even though, technically, as long as the jacks have the same wiring pattern on both ends, in America, we use [EIA/TIA 568-B](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIA/EIA-568) as our wiring standard.  This will be [displayed on the side of your RJ45 jack](http://www.cabletiesandmore.com/images/network_products/products/rj45jack-u.jpg).
 * In your wiring closet, leave a loop of 6 feet or so (for future upgrades/troubleshooting), and then terminate all the cable ends into a labeled [patch panel](http://www.amazon.com/Intellinet-12-Port-Wall-mount-Patch-560269/dp/B000BSJJ1M/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1421692300&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=12+port+patch+panel&amp;pebp=1421692301807&amp;peasin=B000BSJJ1M).  
 * Pop your RJ45 jack into the keystone hole in the faceplate. (tab down, you don't want dust to settle into the wire contacts), and screw in your faceplate.  Label it, if you can do so and it looks nice (""Living Room 1"", etc) so it corresponds to the patch panel in the basement/closet/etc.

Congrats, you've run a cable!  It's female at both ends, so you can just use a patch cable to run from the wall to your PC, and from the patch panel to your switch, to your modem/router, etc.  This wire is now a part of the infrastructure of your house - you won't have to cut anything out when you leave, you just unplug the wires and leave the infrastructure for the next person.

You start off by washing the leaves a few times with hot, not boiling water. This eliminates any small particles, and will produce a clear brew. After boiling water in the large kettle, you pour it over into the smaller top kettle with your washed tea leaves. I like to place the small kettle directly on the stove to bring it to a quick boil, just until the leaves rise to the surface. This gives it a richer flavor in my experience. You then place the small kettle back over the large one, and let it steep for about ten minutes over a very low flame. Et voilà, Turkish tea. It's recommended to consume within half an hour/maaaybe an hour, or it'll go bitter and kinda rancid.

I think Baltimore City gov needs a comprehensive audit as there is clearly waste and fraud. Where to cut how much fat and tighten up efficiency of services cannot be known without this basic step.  There are things underway to begin 3 audits right now.

Baltimroe city is unfortunately trapped as its own county when clearly it is the economic driver and ancestor of this area. Baltimore's lack of including in teh metro area that it spawned has allowed the younger counties to strand local poor and problems int eh city, then underfund it while they ironically complain about the condition of the city - the very condition they created and reinforce.

Baltimore needs to significantly cut its property tax just as San Francisco and Boston did 30 years ago and this will spur reinvestment and in turn begin to remedy many of the city's ills.  All a local sales tax will do is further encourage money to move/stay in the counties.

Weird.

On phone so will paraphrase: the British Empire at least had more than enough manpower available. The question was whether to train non-Indian native populations in the craft of modern war. Whites were highly valued as soldiers and did not like fighting next to coloreds of any sort. There was also a big concern about the dangers of teaching Africans and some Asians the craft of modern European war, lest a corps of professionally trained nationalist soldiers be used against white settlers post-bellum.

So while yes, the White ranks were running thin - particularly in the French Army, indigenous soldiers from the reaches of Empire were still mostly held back as porters and quartermasters. There was one story about how the Maori from New Zealand, magnificent fighters, were frustrated at being held on garrison duty in Malta.

So logically, one would expect that if the shortage of white troops grew too severe, native soldiers would fill the combat roles well before the consideration of women.

One doesn't fix cheating by pleasing their partner. One fixes it by changing whatever crappy things are in their character that allowed them to cheat.

You get an amazing amount of warmth next to the body, try it. Layers, lots of layers, look at some Renaissance outfits, they wore a lot of layers for many reasons, one was warmth. (A lot of Rennies complain that historically accurate Renaissance clothing is very hot because of all the layers and the fabrics.) That was the during [Little Ice Age](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ice_Age), people were cold. So, lots of layers, fur, wool, keeping dry kept people from freezing to death. (It was not always cold, previous to the Little Ice Age the climate was [relatively warm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Warm_Period).) Staying inside a warmish, somewhat windproof structure helped. Housing and warming technologies greatly improved during the Little Ice Age, they had to!

Cotton is not good for warmth. It absorbs sweat and keeps it next to the body, making it colder. (Cotton was relatively rare in the past, in our current times, cotton is ubiquitous, but it will not keep you as warm as wool or other animal products.) Wool wicks sweat away from the body. A dry body is easier to keep warm than a damp body.

Even with all this, people were cold. The idea was not to be ""warm,"" but to not freeze to death so one could make it to the spring.

https://www.amazon.com/Israel-Lobby-U-S-Foreign-Policy/dp/0374531501,,The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy,"Prophet, good question, and I will answer it in another way because the answer you got from /u/Desinynerd comes from a a guy who has an agenda - a pro Israeli one. Let me explain: Israel has been launching a propaganda war for years now in which they want to manipulate social media sites such as Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, etc. They also pander to certain voting blocs in order to sway voters to be anti-Palestinian and Muslim (see pro-European PDIGA movement)

They literally have room dedicated where ""students"" can go and get paid to post absolute propaganda bullshit:

http://www.jpost.com/PromoContent/IDC-fights-war-on-another-front-362989

as well as here

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/students-offered-grants-if-they-tweet-proisraeli-propaganda-8760142.html

You can do your own independent research and find many more. In fact, Israelis had a similar tool called the Desktop Megaphone tool in which any and every online vote concerning Israel or Israeli interests would be automatically vote brigated and manipulated to fit Jewish interests:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaphone_desktop_tool

So it is not just US Internal Politics that Israelis subvert, it is the very online discourse, as proven by your 'answer' from Destinynerd and many other conveniently placed Israelis on /r/worldnews. Have you ever wondered why they have such a large base on /r/worldnews and why the articles trend so differently the past year? Interesting, no?

Anyway, as for the political side, its much easier to subvert and manipulate. I would recommend this: http://www.amazon.com/Israel-Lobby-U-S-Foreign-Policy/dp/0374531501/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1422042750&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+israeli+lobby , The Israeli Lobby was written by 2 of the most prominent political theorists of our generation and goes in depth to explain the level of support Israel gets is unlike ANY other country and to simply dismiss it as 'a small lobby' as Detinynerd has is downright propaganda. The Israelis DO actively subvert and manipulate US politics, but the Israeli Lobby is just a start. 

In fact, Alan Dershowitz is the most prominent legal pusher and internal Jewish lobbyist FOR Israel and was recently accused of a sex pedophilia ring involving Epstein (billionaire Jew) and Prince Charles.

http://gawker.com/flight-logs-put-clinton-dershowitz-on-pedophile-billio-1681039971

The newest data shows Dershowitz Epstein and Bill Clinton were involved in the sex scandal of underage girls. So on ONE side you have someone telling you, ignore what you say, its all racist and ignorant, Jews have no control. On the other I just presented to you a swath of evidence ending with the fact that even Presidents have had direct ties with Jews that have 'provided' certain things. How are they able to do this? Does anything I just presented paint them as the powerless people /u/Destinynerd explained? YOU do the thinking. Not him.",29,t1_cnymerg,PersianPenisBox,0,29,1422043003,t5_2qh13,0,worldnews

* I would second the suggestion to think about getting a dog-walker midday. 9 hours is really pushing it - especially if you get a smaller dog (with a therefore smaller bladder). If you do that, your schedule will be fine for low-medium-energy dogs.
* Yes, with mixed-breed dogs, visual ID is highly unreliable. The advantage of getting an adult dog is that their personalities and temperaments are pretty much set, so knowing the breed background really isn't as important as it would be for predicting the future temperament of a puppy. With a rescue group, they have their dogs in foster for a while (the rescue where I adopted mine had a 2-week minimum before the dogs were available, so they could evaluate them), so they should be able to tell you about their good and bad qualities, habits, likes and dislikes, etc. The descriptions in the ads are just a starting place - once you make contact, you should have more extensive conversation about the dog with the foster.
* Yes, once you've gone through talking about a dog and everything sounds good, do a meet-and-greet. Try *really* hard not to go to it already committed - do your best to be objective in evaluating the dog, and do not feel pressured to say yes and take the dog home right then if you're unsure.
* As for guidance about adopting an adult, I recommend Patricia McConnell's [Love Has No Age Limit.](http://www.amazon.com/Love-Limit-Welcoming-Adopted-into-Your/dp/1891767143) She is a trainer and a PhD in animal behavior, and her books are excellent.

Don't let all these negative comments scare you. The beautiful thing about your relationship is that it's **yours**, and you two(or more!) get to tailor it to whatever suits you.

What you're talking about is commonly described as a ""Don't Ask Don't Tell"" style of open relationship. While not impossible, it does seem to make it a bit harder for most to keep things civil. I can tell you from personal experience that when my wife and I started with this style of relationship, we weren't ready for the amount of communication that was required to make this work, and we faltered. Years later, we have the luxury of time and experience to guide us into what has become a great source of fun for us both, without all the drama we started with.

Watering 4 times a day is drowning the roots.  They aren't able to get any oxygen.  You should be watering once every 4 days or something.  When you water, you should get 20% runoff each time.  Only water once the soil is dry.  You can check by dipping your finger an inch or two down.

Now setup a simple house fan to blow continuously on the plants.  This will help prevent some pests as well as bud rot.

https://www.amazon.com/Tank-Killers-History-Americas-Destroyer/dp/1932033807,,The Tank Killers: A History of America's World War II Tank Destroyer Force,"&gt;When did the concept of having separate tanks and tank destroyers end for a single Main Battle Tank?

So you seem to be asking two questions here, first, when did the tank destroyer fall out of favor, and second, when did the idea of tanks killing other tanks become a thing.

I will try to answer both questions, though my familiarity is mostly with US tanks so this answer will be through the lens of the US's experience. 

**Tank Destroyers**

The US's tank destroyer doctrine was born out of a reaction to the fall of France. At the time, 1940 to be specific, US doctrine specified that there should be both Medium and Light tanks and both should be expected to perform the role of supporting infantry and fighting other tanks. This can be seen in [FM 17-10](http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/ref/FM/PDFs/FM17-10.PDF).

At this point the two main tanks in the US's arsenal was the [M3 Light](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/brotherinarms/images/3/30/97684296_7f24df7a08.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120313160054) and the [M2 Medium](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7f/M2A1.jpg) both armed with a high velocity 37mm gun. 

The rapid fall of France though came as quite the surprise to the US. The German Panzer spearheads had seemingly crushed all that had opposed them, and given that the US was concerned that they would eventually be drawn into a conflict with Germany, rightfully so as it turned out, the Army set about developing a doctrine to defeat the Panzers. 

A meeting was held in mid 1941 to glean what they could from the French experience and to decide how to counter the German threat.

The reports from France seemed to show few things, first that the French tank doctrine of Infantry and Cavalry tanks was an ineffective one because the Infantry tanks lacked adequate AT capabilities and the Cavalry tanks were much too few. The second issue was that the French relied mostly on infantry served AT guns which were once again rather rare and ill employed. 

Unfortunately for the US, the French situation somewhat reflected their own in that the infantry simply wasn't provided adequate AT support. The short term solution to this problem was to attach a dedicated AT battalion to infantry divisions but this wasn't seen as a good enough solution and it was generally considered that creating a mobile anti-tank reserve attached to Corps or Armies was the best solution. After some infighting about who should control this new force the task of organizing the new tank destroyer force was given to General McNair, an artilleryman and it is from him that many misconceptions about the US's Armored Force comes from. He believed for instance that tanks should be confined to supporting infantry while the tank destroyers fought tanks^1. Luckily for everyone, he wasn't in charge of the Armored Force. Another thing to note is that the Armored Force had a somewhat different reaction to the German success in France and in fact they had dismissed the chance to control the new Tank Destroyer Force because they felt it went against their doctrine and offensive mindset. Their reaction to the fall of France was to demand that a 75mm gun, capable of both killing tanks and supporting infantry, be equipped in the next generation of tanks, and that is how the M3 and M4 ended up with the M3 75mm gun. The Sherman was also designed as a result, and it proved to be an excellent tank.

Its important to keep in mind that the tank destroyer, at least as the US envisioned it, was a primarily defensive doctrine. It was intended as a reserve force that would be employed against mass Panzer attacks. And perhaps it might have been good at combating such attacks, but in the event such mass spearheads never really materialized, and so the doctrine never really got tested. Instead the TDs were employed basically as commanders saw fit, and that usually meant they were employed as tanks. 

Now that isn't to say that the TD's were themselves failures. In fact they were often quite successful with the average kill loss ratio (tanks) of Tank Destroyer battalions being about 3:1 with some as high as 10:1.^2 But when it really came down to it, the TD force was rather redundant. By the end of the war they were armed mostly the same as the Shermans that made up the majority of the Armored Force but they were not nearly as well armored, which made them less useful. Post war studies showed that even the TDs were firing 11 HE rounds for every AP round fired and so by 1945 it became quite obvious that the TDs offered nothing that a tank couldn't also provide in a much better package. So in 1946, as a result of both the realization that TDs were redundant and budgets cuts, the TD arm was shut down. But as I mentioned, tanks had always been intended to fight other tanks, and by the end of the war they were just as capable of doing so as the TDs. 

Now as far as the transition from TDs and Mediums to MBTs? Well in American service that is a little bit murky. Even during WW2 the Medium tank, in this case the M4 Sherman, was undoubtedly the main battle tank of the Armored Force, the MBT concept is after all an evolution of the Medium tank. But after the war the Armored Force was mostly made up of Mediums. M4s, M26s, M46s, M47s, and then finally the M48s. All of these tanks were considered medium tanks, but they increasingly made up more and more of the US's armored forces. 

For a more detailed look at the development of the Pattons, please take a look at [this album](http://imgur.com/a/kpOEp) I created on them.

Anyway, at the same time that those tanks were being fielded the Army still used light tanks, the M41 and the M551, and a heavy tank, the M103, though the M103 was really a tank that the Marines wanted, the Army didn't see much use for them. 

Then by the time that the M60 began development however people in the US and elsewhere were realizing that the tanks like the Lights and Heavies were becoming increasingly limited. You could always put a big enough gun into a medium to kill any heavy and the mediums were nearly as mobile as the lights. So the M60 was really the first MBT in US service, though the M551 was developed around the same time so perhaps we didn't necessarily follow the doctrine to a T, and we still don't really, the Bradley is basically a light tank after all. 

Now as far as other nations go, well, few nations purpose built their TDs at least at first. 

The first German TD for instance was the [Panzerjäger I](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panzerj%C3%A4ger_I) which was simply an expedient way of mounting an AT gun on an availible chassis, in this case a Panzer I. The StuG III, which is a famous Tank Destroyer, was originally an assault gun intended for infantry support. It was only after encountering Russian armor like the T-34 and KV-1 that the Germans really pursued the tank destroyer concept, though unlike the Americans, they never built tank destroyers with turrets. 

The Russians experimented with Tank Destroyers before the war though the tests were usually more geared towards AA guns and artillery, but like the Germans, didn't start fielding them in material numbers until the war was on. 

The same goes for the British, they didn't seriously pursue tank destroyers until the war was on and they used quite a few Americans TDs. 

Now despite the US giving up on dedicated TDs right after the war, the concept didn't die around the rest of the world. The Kanonenjagdpanzer was a TD used by West Germany from 1965 until 1990 and the British introduced the FV4101 Cromwell Heavy AT Gun though it was never deployed with front line British units. 

A number of modern vehicles could also be seen as tank destroyers, there are a number of AFVs primarily armed with wire guided missiles  for instance and then there is the Chinese Type 89 TD and the American M1128, which is apparently terrible, and the B1 Centauro are examples of gun armed AFVs which could be called TDs, or maybe light tanks, take your pick. 

So like light tanks, TDs haven't entirely fallen out of favor, despite the supremacy of the MBT. 

So I hope I answered your question, at least from a US perspective. If you have any more questions please let me know.

* Cut block of firm or extra firm tofu in half 
* Wrap in a towel and put something heavy on it. Let it sit 10-15 minutes.
* Take a bag of cut broccoli from trader joes, put it in a bowl, put a dash of water on it and cover the bowl with a plate. Microwave for 2 minutes.
* Heat a pan or wok on very high heat.  I usually let it heat up for 3-4 minutes.
* Put some canola oil in the pan - I don't measure, but use enough to coat the bottom of the pan. probably 2 tablespoons.  At this point you have to be careful with the heat.  I set the oil on fire once at my sister's house (oops! didn't know her range well enough).  So if you're not sure how hot your burners are, use less heat.
* Let the oil sit 1 minute or so.  While waiting, cut the tofu into cubes.
* Throw the tofu in the pan.  If you got things hot enough it won't stick.
* Use a spatula and move the tofu around a lot.  Brown it on all sides.  Should take a couple of minutes
* Throw the broccoli in
* Toss for another 2 minutes
* Cover it with hoisin sauce (about 1/4 cup should do) and whatever else you like.  I usually throw in some red pepper flakes and soy sauce. But hoisin sauce is pretty tasty by itself.
* Serve over rice or noodles

For a long time I could never get tofu to turn out right. The two things I found that were critical:

* Press the water out of it. Use a hand towel and plenty of weight.  I use cookbooks.
* Heat the pan before you put oil in.  The hotter the pan is the better (up to the smoke point of the oil of course).  When my tofu doesn't turn out it's usually because I was impatient and threw the oil and tofu in before I had the pan hot enough.

Hope that helps, and just keep trying.  I seriously screwed up a few dozen times before I got it down.  It helps to invest in some decent cookware.  I use these [Cuisinart stainless steel pans](http://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-77-10-Stainless-10-Piece-Cookware/dp/B00008CM68/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1422679764&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=cuisinart+pans) and they work really well.

I HATE sandwiches so the best thing to do was this.
 
My variation/generalization of the [Serious Eats](http://www.seriouseats.com/) post on the idea [found here](http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/09/diy-instant-noodle-cups-food-lab.html).
 
Each of these is a pint jar (mine are blue, ignore the weird color), and at lunch time just fill up with hot water (I use the hot water spout on the coffee machines) and let steep for 3 minutes or so, and enjoy.
 
Per Jar you'll need (all oz are weight)
 
 * 1 oz of Noodles 
 * Tiny amount of olive oil
 * 3 oz of Protein
 * 1/4 of an onion / 1 small shallot
 * 1/4 cup of almost any vegetable
 * 1/2 TBSP of good bouillon
 * salt, pepper, and dried herbs for seasoning
 
Cook the noodles like normal, drain, then rinse the noodles with cold water to stop the cooking. If the noodles overcook then they'll be soggy in the jar. Drizzle a little amount of olive oil to coat the noodles and add a little flavor.

YO YOU BEST NOT OVERCOOK THEM NOODLES CUZ DAM SON YO NOODLES GONN BE SOGGY YO
 
The 3 oz of protein can basically be anything, just not raw. Beef jerky, any kind of beans, shrimp, shredded chicken, etc. The meat in mine is home-made roast beef.
 
Slice the onion/shallot thinly or dice finely depending on what you like. The other vegetable can again be personal preference. I'm using shaved radishes and carrots since I had that on hand. Frozen vegetables work perfectly fine, just make sure the vegetables are in small pieces, like frozen peas or break up the block of spinach. 

The good bouillon is probably the most expensive part, if you can get something like [Better than Bouillon](http://www.amazon.com/Better-Than-Bouillion-Vegetable-Base/dp/B00016LA9S/ref=sr_1_2?s=grocery&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1421733144&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=better+than+bouillon) it works great, if that's too pricy you can use a regular dry block of bouillon. Normally I'd use a whole TBSP of bouillon, but my roast beef was heavily spiced so I cut back a little. 
 
Lastly salt,pepper and herb to taste. Mine have thyme and oregano in them. I don't have fresh herb, but the serious eats people like to keep fresh herbs on hand and put them in after the soup has steeped. 
 
Since I splurged on my meat these are a little more expensive, but overall its very cheap. A 1 pound box of noodles makes 16 of these jars, and if you buy your vegetables on sale its very cheap. Mine came out to be about 2.50 a jar. Try them out and let me know what combinations you did!",91,t1_cnuovlm,Drumulum,0,91,1421733419,t5_2vvpi,0,EatCheapAndHealthy

Cultural Marxism is not an invention of the paranoid right. It's a school of thought developed by left-wing Marxists and named by them as such because it describes the application of their own theory to culture rather than economics. Whether you agree with the movement or disagree with the movement, saying that it's not a movement, or that William Lind created a fictitious movement in 1998, is absurd. You are either misinformed or lying.

Below is a list of sources drawn exclusively from professors and scholars practicing cultural Marxism in which they use the term to describe the Frankfurt- and Birmingham-descended schools of thought.

The phrase refers to any critique of culture that has been informed by Marxist thought. Although scholars around the globe have employed various types of Marxist critique to analyze cultural artifacts, the two most influential have been the Institute for Social Research at the University of Frankfurt am Main in Germany (the Frankfurt School) and the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies in Birmingham, UK. The latter has been at the center of a resurgent interest in the broader category of Cultural Studies.""

The essay ""Cultural Marxism and Cultural Studies,"" by UCLA Professor Douglas Kellner, says "" 20th century Marxian theorists ranging from Georg Lukacs, Antonio Gramsci, Ernst Bloch, Walter Benjamin, and T.W. Adorno to Fredric Jameson and Terry Eagleton employed the Marxian theory to analyze cultural forms in relation to their production, their imbrications with society and history, and their impact and influences on audiences and social life... There are, however, many traditions and models of cultural studies, ranging from neo-Marxist models developed by Lukàcs, Gramsci, Bloch, and the Frankfurt school in the 1930s to feminist and psychoanalytic cultural studies to semiotic and post-structuralist perspectives (see Durham and Kellner 2001).""

I hope that this brief survey amply demonstrates that Cultural Marxism is a term created and actively used by progressive scholars to describe the school of thought that first developed at Frankfurt and Birmingham to apply Marxism to cultural studies.

Bernanke and Friedman are in basic agreement on the Federal Reserve being the cause of the depression.  Bernanke is famous for having said: ""Let me end my talk by abusing slightly my status as an official representative of the Federal Reserve. I would like to say to Milton and Anna: Regarding the Great Depression. You're right, we did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again.""  I should add that although Friedman is sometimes seen as a free-market hack, his work on monetary theory and the great depression is respected by economists of all political stripes. 

Modern central bankers now know to increase the money supply during a recession.  This is necessary to prevent deflation because the effective amount of money circulating in the economy is increased by lending.  Lending decreases during a recession, so if the central bank does not increase ""base money"", then the effective amount of money will decrease in the recession. A fall in the money supply can cause problems, particularly for banks if the duration of their assets and liabilities differ (as is almost always the case) (fyi, the duration of and asset or liabilities is basically when it pays out.  Mortgages have a long duration because mortgage holders will be baying back their debts over decades.  Demand deposits have a short duration -- consumers can withdraw their deposits on a day's notice to take them to another bank or take them home.  If the interest rate goes up, then consumers can withdraw their deposits to get a bigger return on them, but banks cannot call their mortgages.  Thus, banks are typically hurt when interest rates go up.  Furthermore, if enough people start withdrawing their deposits, the bank can run out of cash -- even if their mortgages are good and they'd be able to pay back their depositors if given enough time.  This can result in a bank run.  If a lot of people withdraw their deposits, then the bank will go bankrupt and the other depositors could be ruined.  Thus, lots of depositors may withdraw their deposits in anticipation that others will, causing a bank failure that would not have happened otherwise.  Banks failing and being close to failure will reduce the supply of credit to various enterprises, which directly reduces output (this is the link between the ""real economy"" and the financial economy.  In a market economy, the financial sector plays a crucial role in determining to which enterprises capital is allocated.  Banks can do a good job identifying where capital is most productive, but during a liquidity crises they will fail to extend this credit -- they know the project is good but they can't give the money without going bankrupt). 

At the start of the great depression, the US Federal reserve decreased the money supply rather than increasing it, transforming what would probably have been a sharp but brief recession (as the United States had experience regularly throughout its history) into the great depression.  Indeed, the effective money supply decreased by over a third early in the great depression.

There were a couple of reasons for this, but part of it came from a power struggle between the New York Fed and the Washington DC fed.  In the 1800's and early 1900's, big financiers like J.P.Morgan played the role of the federal reserve by generously extending financing during contractions to avert catastrophe.  After the panic of 1907 (where J.P. Morgan assembled a coalition of other bankers to extend credit to banks during the liquidity crisis),  many bankers urged the creation of a government body to play the role that J.P. Morgan had played in the past, thinking something like ""we only avoided catastrophe because J.P.Morgan saved the day - what if someone like J.P. Morgan is not around for the next crisis?  We need an official body to play this role"".  This resulted in the Federal reserve board.  

The Federal reserve board is a fairly decentralized system.  The D.C. fed is responsible for controlling money supply.  But the New York Fed has always been better connected with the banks and more proactive in extending credit during liquidity crises.    When the federal reserve boards were founded, Benjamin Strong was appointed the first governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and continued the practice of providing strong support of the banks during liquidity crises (exe. extending emergency credit).

However, the D.C. fed wanted to centralize power, and reflexively opposed the actions of the New York Fed as a means to acquire this power.  Benjamin Strong was an effective leader and was able to resist the encroachment of the D.C. fed.  Unfortunately, he died in 1928 on the eve of the stock market crash.  Thus, when the crash happened, the D.C. fed was able to assert its authority unopposed and prevent the New York Fed from extending credit to distressed banks at the outset of the crises. 

In addition, many banks around the world at this time were trying to strengthen their currencies (the dollar is strong if it can buy relatively more euros, for example).  One way to accomplish this is to raise interest rates, because money from foreign countries will rush in to buy the higher-interest rate assets, thus bidding up the price of the dollar.  If many central banks in different countries do this at once, the result is no change in the strength of the currencies but large increases in the interest rate in all countries.  Many countries were caught up in this game of competing for a strong currency, with the US and France at the forefront (France also had a terrible great depression). Unfortunately, the Fed increases interest rates by buying up bonds, so the Fed was actually reducing the money supply at the outset of the great depression, which is the exact opposite of what should be done. 

As for other countries, the UK did not tighten monetary policy after the initial recession like the United States did.  They had a relatively brief and less severe recession.

Canada also did not tighten monetary policy.  In addition, Canada had fewer, larger banks, whereas the United States had an abundance of small banks.  Small banks are less diversified and are more likely to go under during a credit crunch.  This is why not many (actually, i don't think any) of the banks in Canada went under.  But something like a third of all banks in the United States went bankrupt in the early phases of the great depression.  The reason the United States had many small banks was because there were regulations preventing banks from growing very large.  I can't remember the details of these regulations, but I believe they prevented banks from operating in multiple states.  

TLDR
the great depression probably would have been a minor recession except for the fact that a recently founded federal agency led by naive and power-hungry leadership both failed to extend credit to banks during a liquidity crisis (as banking giants like J.P. Morgan had done in the past) and actively reduced the money supply in pursuit of a strong dollar.  In addition, regulations limiting the size of banks made the US financial system more vulnerable to financial shocks. 

It sounds like I am blaming government and saying that the Fed should not exist.  That is not the case.  The Fed can be beneficial if it is run correctly, and the current leadership is much more knowledgeable about how the macro economy works than the leadership was in the past. Criticizing bad regulation is not the same as criticizing regulation.  In any case, the Great Depression probably would not have happened if either the Fed didn't exist or the Fed had been properly managed.

By volume: 92 cbm / 0.0158267 cbm = 5813 cases

By weight: 25t / 3.25kg = 7692 cases

Which means that the load could at best be 5813 cases.

From a western perspective this seems odd, but is actually the ""normal"" human condition.  Everything that follows is from Marvin Harris's book *Our Kind*, which I'm trying to simplify into ELI5 style.

Lactose is the sugar in milk.  Your body can't use lactose, and has to break it down into simpler sugars.  This is done by the enzyme lactase.  ""Naturally"" mammals produce lactase while they are nursing from their mothers, but then stop producing it as they grow older because ""naturally"" they won't ever consume milk again.

I say ""naturally"" and ""normal"" because humans are different, we developed agriculture and domesticated other animals.  This takes us out of the natural cycle a bit, allows us to do things our biology wasn't really intended for.  However, natural selection still applies - if we do something that increases our survival rate and success at reproducing, that trait will be selected and pass on to the next generation, propagate and become ""normal"".  These traits can be genetic (genes, like being strong or fast) or cultural (memes, like wearing makeup).

When we started domesticating milk-producing animals such as goats or cows, we gained the option to consume milk as adults.  Our natural state does not allow us to do that, but some individuals would be different and possess a mutation wherein they would continue producing lactase as adults, allowing them to consume milk. In some cultures that trait was very valuable, resulting in increased survival and reproduction, thus the trait became very common and eventually the ""normal"".  In other cultures the trait had no net gain and therefore does not propagate, and so not the ""normal"".

So what's the difference in the cultures?  What makes adult lactase production a big win for those of Northern European descent, but pretty worthless for East Asians?  It has to do with geography and available sources of calcium and vitamin D.

You need calcium in your diet.  You can get that calcium a few different ways - milk being one, leafy green vegetables being another.  To make use of calcium your body also needs either vitamin D or lactose.  You can get vitamin D from seafood, or your body can make it when exposed to sunlight.  Without vitamin D, lactose assists with the use of calcium.   So, cultures with easy access to leafy greens plus sunlight or fish, calcium is taken care of and milk has no advantage.  Cultures without access to leafy greens - or without access to sunlight or seafood - need dairy either as a source of calcium, or a source of lactose to use the calcium, or both.

This leads to the difference between dairy that's fermented (yogurt or most cheese) or unfermented (straight up milk).  Fermented dairy products still have the calcium, but the lactose is broken down into simpler sugars, so lactase is not necessary to digest it.  Therefore a culture with access to fish or sunlight but not leafy greens would benefit greatly from keeping dairy animals, but don't benefit from still creating lactase as adults - they consume the milk as yogurt or cheese to get all the calcium they need and make use of that calcium thanks to vitamin D.

So now finally, enter the Northern Europeans - the people that would eventually become western society as we know it today - developed in a climate that required them to bundle up most of the time due to extreme cold, so no sunlight to make vitamin D.  They also had very little seafood in their diets at the time (~12,000 years ago), and limited access to leafy green vegetables.  Calcium and vitamin D are lacking.  So, those individuals who possessed the ability to consume unfermented dairy as adults had an advantage.  They survived and bred more frequently, thus passing the trait on and making it ""normal"".  Within 5000 years after the domestication of dairy animals, 90% of northern Europeans possessed the ability to produce lactase into adulthood and dairy of all types was commonplace.

Meanwhile let's consider China ~12,000 years ago.  Leafy greens were a major part of the diet, so calcium is not an issue.  Those in coastal areas developed fishing techniques much earlier than Europeans, as well as a trade infrastructure to transport that seafood pretty far into the mainland, so vitamin D is not an issue.  Thus no advantage to unfermented dairy consumption among the bulk of Chinese.  Only those far inland and to the north would have an issue - those peoples who became the Mongols, who did consume dairy.  Furthermore even fermented dairy never took hold in Chinese culture because of their trade networks - the Chinese were able to obtain their labor animals from other cultures (tibetans, mongols, etc) - therefore did not breed their own cows or goats.  Pigs were the primary meat animal raised.  With no need for dairy, and without really having it around in the first place, they developed into a culture with virtually zero dairy of any type.  And much like the Northern Europeans went on to culturally dominate western civilization, Chinese culture influenced many others in Asia.

So... in summary (TL;DR): Dairy consumption has 2 extremes produced by geography and available diets:  Lots of dairy including raw milk driven by Northern Europeans, and virtually zero dairy of any kind driven by the Chinese.  Between those extremes are everybody else, who for the most part made use of fermented dairy for its calcium, but remain lactose intolerant.

**Edit 2:**  I'm getting a lot of follow up questions on specific cultures - this isn't a complete history of the world, it doesn't cover everyone.  I am not an anthropologist, as I said in the first paragraph this is an attempt to simplify the work of Marvin Harris, specifically his book [Our Kind](http://www.amazon.com/Our-Kind-Where-Came-Going/dp/0060919906).  I'd say that book is like the Cosmos of anthropology - it's an excellent read, very approachable, and great at chaining together complex history, geography, and biology to tell the story of modern human evolution.  If you want more detail on what I wrote, I highly recommend starting there.

Quite a few are historically inaccurate and I guess you have been mislead on these otherwise verifiable areas. I hope you take this feedback as constructive and not confrontational. I will as always back up my claims with some solid secondary sources.

&gt;I can only assume this because the Indian subcontinent is fairly large, and the ratio of british to Indian in India must have been ridiculous. Like 10000:1 (made up number).

It was worse. At no point in time did the population of native Brits exceed 1,50,000 *(1)* with the Indian population hovering around 250 Mn ~ 1850. However, it was not as the Indian mutiny showed as easy as ganging up together as 250 Mn and throwing out the Brits.

It is established that any insurgency needs 6% to 8% of the population joining it to become a success. This given the geographical (another inconsistency of yours) boundaries and size of India was a very difficult number to achieve BEFORE the advent of modern communications. *(2)*

The British also ruled in a very clever manner. They supplanted the existing caste system, replaced the Mughal emperors / Maratha emperors at the top with themselves and ruled via the kings and zamindars. The average Indian saw no change in the ruling dispensation and hence had no cause to complain. Again this was slowly changing and the resistance if you will achieved critical mass by the 1900's. Gandhi for all his political guile (and stupidity) harvested this wave. What the Brits did was, even to exploit, they let their kings and zamindars do all the exploitation. They levied taxes on these intermediaries and let them be once they paid said taxes. In the few areas under their own direct control like Bengal, they attempted land reforms which were disastrous *(3)* and these areas coincidentally became the vanguard of the freedom movement.

The point here is, you over simplify the whole Indians could have kicked out the Brits whenever if he had used violence. It wasn't ever as simple as that. The violence was also not long in the coming, and that was one of the greatest fears of the British. The lakhs of demobbed soldiers returning from WW2 rising up against the Raj.

What did the Raj in was not Gandhi or Bose but Hitler. Britain just did not have the resources to maintain the ever increasingly restive Indian colony. The Indian naval mutiny was an act, combined with the spectre of the recently defeated INA hovering over them that caused fear to the British rulers. *(4)*. Interestingly the revolt was caused by more mundane issues such as delayed pay, slow demob process but it sure did fan the embers of nationalism and picked up speed because of nationalism.

This is where I find fault with your central thesis on Gandhi's method. In a way, we should be greatful that our colonisers were the Brits ( inspite of all the horrors they inflicted on us) and not say the Japanese or Germans who would have resorted to deadly force to any unrest. This is what if territory and I will end this line of reasoning here as it has no basis in historical reality. Suffice to say Indians as a whole are hard sold on the ""Gandhi won us freedom"" rhetoric that we usually fail to look at it objectively.

I will skip the stuff in between (in terms of the rebuttal) as they are mostly opinions and jump straight to,

&gt;When we look at the Indian Subcontinent [IS], it becomes obvious that if we had start to divide this piece of land on religious and cultural fault-lines then this land can easily be divided into 50-odd countries. The diversity is simply overwhelming.

This is another idea we have been hard sold, India is so diverse, that we can never, and have in the past never been one or two entities.

Historically this is highly inaccurate.

We have had 2, 3 empires at any given point in time controlling the vast majority of the subcontinent. These (Mauryas, Cholas, Rashtrakutas, Pratihara Palas, Gurjaras etc etc) weren't a feudal replica of medieval Europe, but similar to the centrally run Chinese system. All these empires (each of which lasted for centuries) had a central administration system, central coinage, central bureaucracy and acted pretty much as one solid unit. *(5)* , *(6)*, *(7)*, *(8)*, *(9)*

I am now (as it is more relevant here) going to jump forward a section and bring in your,

&gt;This brings a wild conjecture in my head. Originally, like 3000 years ago, the religious fault-lines in Hinduism were clearly defined. These really were 100 different religions. People worshiped rudra, ram etc .... the list goes on and on and hated/despised each other for worship other gods.
Different kinds of people had different cultural practices. When population was scare, people were separated by long distances. One part of India practiced paganism, 100 kms away the other part practiced polytheism, some were monotheists, while down in far south people were following pantheism.
Now population spiked, and kingdoms had to be formed. Large scale conquering-and-killing followed just like any other part of the world (imagine Europe). Eventually the people of Indian Subcontinent realized what this azerbaijan-ian dude realized. That we are not separated by geographical barriers and we will wipe each-other out if we do not stop the killing and conquering.
To stop the perpetual war, the Indians came up with a bright idea. Lets stop demonizing each-other (followers of other gods), and respect the sacred texts/building of people from different culture/faith. Because if you don't respect them, they won't respect you, 10 years later will come with an army of war elephants and fuck your ass sideways.

This is highly incorrect and if you would read sources 5, 6, 7, 8 &amp; 9 (or even just 5 &amp; 7) you will understand why.

Firstly Indian geography was as flat (relatively) as you suggest only in the Gangetic plains. For any medieval army to even cross the Dandakaranya (dense impenetrable forest) and the Vindhyas after that to mount an expedition in the south of India it was an arduous task. Keep in mind in ancient and medieval India, most of the land was a densely forested or swampy marsh land with massive amounts of malarial mosquitoes. It is not as easy as you postulate. It was still done, there were paths and valleys and roads which armies used, but it was not easy. Also you forget distance. The Pallava emperor, if he gathered his army in Mahabalipuram and had to sack Vengi, he had to march some 700 odd km's. Think about it in European terms, 700 Km's would get you from Berlin to Paris (or close).

Neelakanta Sastri in his history of south India suggests that yes, the south had a distinctively different culture and religion, but slow cultural movements from the north changed this into a more uniform mixture over centuries and resulted in a very syncretic mixture of the native pagans and the more recognised Hinduism (as we recognise it that is). 

I will address more such historical fallacies and inaccuracies over time, but this will do for a start.

There's been a tendency in recent movies to portray witches as being actual devil worshipers (for example, in [*Black Death*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death_%28film%29) [2010]), who were being persecuted because they were following religious traditions that actively threatened the Christian establishment. There's some academic support for this idea - Carlo Ginzburg, for example, [has argued that paganism survived, secretly, in medieval Europe for 1000 years](http://www.amazon.com/Ecstasies-Deciphering-Witches-Carlo-Ginzburg/dp/0226296938), and that this is the witchcraft that church leaders were so concerned with rooting out in the late medieval / early modern period. But this argument is really stretching the available evidence. And, I'll argue, dangerously confuses rhetorical tropes with reality.

The idea that witchcraft is an ancient, anti-establishment tradition that has been standing up to Christianity (and suffering persecution) for thousands of years is a really attractive narrative for many people in the present who want to connect their modern magical practices to an imagined something in the past (as you've noticed), so the idea of an ancient tradition of witchcraft is hard to debunk. And because it makes good film, Hollywood has jumped on the bandwagon, and treats witchcraft as a real religion, rather than the horrible side effect of early modern authoritarianism that it was.

Most of what we know about witchcraft comes from the people who were identifying and persecuting so-called witches. There's little to suggest that the women they targeted were actual devil worshipers: they seem to have usually been women whose social positions (often, widows) left them on the margins of society. Much like today, medieval and early modern authorities maintained and strengthened their power by attacking marginal groups (frequently the Jews, but also these so-called witches). But there's little reason to believe the charges they made against accused witches were based on real things the women had done. Much like antisemitism, the accusations were coming out of Christian beliefs about what witches *should* look like, not responding to the actual actions of the victims within their communities. Believing these accusations and treating them like they represent real beliefs is dangerous, and is rather like telling a story in which a greedy medieval Jew drinks the blood of Christian children (that is, treating a hideous stereotype like a social reality).

There were, of course, lots of kinds of magic in Europe, treated with varying degrees of suspicion by the establishment. [A lot of 'magic' was assimilated into the church](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/4777.html) - for example, in the early middle ages, pictures of Jesus and the apostles were added to pre-Christian (Roman) medical texts to make it clear that their contents were ok (see [this forthcoming dissertation](http://www.princeton.edu/histgrads/profiles/mleja/index.xml)). Monks in 10th century England copied a book of magic spells that used bible verses, herbs, and other treatments that [give every appearance of coming out of pre-Christian practices to heal ailments](http://www.amazon.com/Popular-Religion-Late-Saxon-England/dp/0807845655). Christianity was usually flexible enough to absorb this kind of healing and herb lore. The story you get in the TV miniseries [*World Without End*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1878805/) (2012), where the woman who cures people with herbs gets hanged for her troubles, is more stereotype than reality - those kinds of magical healing activities were widespread in Christian Europe, and didn't usually mark someone out as a witch (even if they had a lot of non-Christian content blended into the things they were doing). Medieval Christianity had a lot of room for diversity, except at a few flash points when local authorities wanted to solidify their power by finding a common religious enemy.

Cohn, Europe's Inner Demons: The Demonization of Christians in Medieval Christendom (Uni Chicago Press: 1993)](http://books.google.com/books/about/Europe_s_Inner_Demons.html?id=7uW-RsCnQGMC).

Some vets in Chicago will even put them on the cat for you. 

It's just like having a nippy dog. Do you want the dog to nip your child? Of course not, but you wouldn't pull it's teeth out to prevent an accident. You'd train it to either not do it, or do it appropriately... As Vultras said, get scratching posts... or soft paws at least. 

My brother was bitten by our dog when we were younger, because he also wasn't trained to not mistreat the dog. He pulled on the dogs ears a bit too much and the dog nipped him. Unfortunate, but he was okay, and it never happened again. 

My cat seriously loves this thing, both for sleeping and scratching:

If your cat is scratching  ""anything and everything"" it hasn't been trained well. Pets are a responsibility, and it's your responsibility to train them to correct behavior.

I went to school with her and knew her while there. Our campus was shared with the national technical institute for the deaf (NTID). So, there is a large deaf population and many programs and classes on ASL available. I am fairly certain that she took some american sign language classes while in school, though that was not her major. She got a lot of criticism over the book (people pointing out some inaccuracies or claiming it is exploitative), though I think many people found it amusing. I don't know much about the backlash from the deaf community, but you can tell from the amazon reviews that there were quite a number of vocal critics. I'd say like almost every group, deaf people are sensitive when it seems someone is trying to exploit their culture. She had a couple of interpreters help her, so I think the message would be able to be understood for the most part by a deaf person (even if it overlooks colloquialisms of the language).",17,t1_cnr80e7,davidb_,0,17,1421438567,t5_2u8qf,0,LearnUselessTalents

Slightly longer answer: The radicalization of Islam in the Middle East ties into the division of the region by the western powers after WWI, and further during the Cold War, when the U.S. (not only, but in particular) supported  the rise to power of radical religious figures in opposition to communist/leftist parties &amp; figures who might be sympathetic to the Soviet Union, and therefore potentially threaten U.S./U.K. access to oil in the region. This included aiding in the over-throwing of democratically elected governments in favor of autocratic but U.S./U.K.-favored leaders - most notably the U.S.-led 1953 coup d'etat in Iran, when Mohammad Mosaddegh was overthrown. The 1978 Iranian Revolution began as a popular uprising against the Shah who replaced him.

The only reason those crops are so popular is because they are more easily taxed and they travel well to feed armies. Root vegetables have a long history of being ""rebellious"" crops. Harder to tax, harder to burn or destroy if the peasants get uppity, and can be stored by simply leaving them in the ground. Not to mention much more nutritious.

Study introductory [predicate logic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_logic).  Break statements into predicates - identify their antecedent and consequent.  Identify the differences between a predicate's [negation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negation), [inverse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_\(logic\)), [converse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converse_\(logic\)), and [contrapositive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraposition); more importantly, how they can be used to derive [logical Truth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_truth).  Familiarize yourself with [Gödel's completeness theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_completeness_theorem).

Next, learn to identify a [fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy); study up on [logical fallacies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies).

[Cognitive Biases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) are the next most important step.  Being aware of your own cognitive biases will help you identify when your analyses are being skewed.

Study everything about everything.  More information about your domain of concern will granter you further insight for analysis.

Lastly, take care of yourself.  Get lots of sleep, eat healthy, and exercise; your judgement will be impaired if you don't.

From [this website](http://www.webstaurantstore.com/foxs-bag-in-box-cola-beverage-soda-syrup-5-gallon/103BIBCOLA.html) I can get a 5 gallon bag of cola syrup for about $35 if I order several.

According to [this website,](http://www.webstaurantstore.com/guide/526/5-gallon-bag-in-box.html) I could make 214 pint-size servings of soda from that 5 gallon bag.  So disregarding the cost of a restaurant's carbonator and the soda machine itself and the network of tubes connecting all that equipment throughout the kitchen, that's about $0.16 per pint, which is the figure we need.

[This price](http://www.amazon.com/SodaStream-Cola-Syrup-500mL/dp/B00M0IWUXU/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1421214559&amp;sr=8-7&amp;keywords=sodastream+syrup) of $4.99 would put the equivalent SodaStream syrup (12 liters, or 25.4 pint-size servings per bottle) at $0.20 per pint.

[I can get Dasani DROPS for $3.59.](http://www.amazon.com/Dasani-DROPS-Cherry-Pomegranate-Bottle/dp/B00IT712US/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1421214668&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=dasani+flavor+drops)  At the recommended serving size, that would give me 16 pints of flavored water at $0.22 apiece.  More expensive than that even, considering that I'm sure everyone uses more than recommended.

Now, if I go to the grocery store, I can get a 2-liter bottle of cola for like, $0.80.  There's 4.2 pint size servings in there at $0.19 per pint, cheaper than both flavor drops and SodaStream but more expensive than restaurant-volume syrups.  Good job, /u/Nefandi!

It's an amazing book that does a great job of tearing down all the bullshit around virginity. No one can even agree on what makes you a virgin. Like you said, some people only think heterosexual people can even lose their virginity. Some people would say masturbating means you're not a virgin, but some people think it takes partnered sex. Virginity is a very vague idea, and not worth becoming too concerned about. Good partners will always realize that the notion of virginity doesn't mean very much.

Also, if you're concerned about future partners, remember that you still get to have a first time *with each person* you sleep with. Every relationship is special, every partnership has a beginning and that period of feeling butterflies when you look at the person you care about.
