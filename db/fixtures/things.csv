I think Make-up Masterclass, Makeup Manual, Makeup Makeovers in 5, 10, 15 Minutes, Makeup Makeovers Beauty Bible and Plastic Surgery Without the Surgery The Miracle of Makeup Techniques share a similar and more ""natural beauty enhanced"" aesthetic and are kind of repetitive.

The Kevyn Aucoin book is great, it covers all of the basics, has lots of ""classic"" looks and even though it was released in 1997 it's still pretty accurate. Just two things: a) New formulas, especially waterless foundation and poured blushes (and other powders), were invented recently and are therefor not mentioned, so keep that in mind when you read the book. b) His (I think) 3 book share content, so don't buy all of them without intensive research. Unfortunately I haven't figured out yet, how much and what kind of material they share. But if someday I do, I may buy another one.

The Yasmin Heinzs book is very interesting, but more on the high fashion/editorial side and afaik just available in German.

The Nars book is, well, different and more on the coffee table book side. [Here](https://www.amazon.com/Makeup-Your-Mind-Express-Yourself/dp/0847836452/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483031922&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=francois+nars) you can find a tiny preview. It doesn't fokus on basics/tecniques, more on the overall result, so I wouldn't recommend it to a beginner. Every look is photographed in front of the same grey background and is retouched very little/not at all. You have two photos: The bare faced model on the right page and the finished result on the left. Between the pages is a clear sheet with product placement references. From time to time some pages with product-specific instructions are inserted (an example of these is included in the preview). The looks themselves are typically Nars: Some times minimal, some times bolder, but never heavy or cakey. And all of the models have beautiful skin, but are otherwise on the diverse side (with two males (one with a 4-to-7-day-beard), which are on the more dramatic side).",9,,creamorlemon,,,2016,12,2016-12-29T17:40:55,t5_342em,0,muacjdiscussion,http://reddit.com/r/muacjdiscussion/comments/5kuqk9/c/dbrfvry,6ce17f92395ef1afe307d99b26b9c74da941350c5668c1bf32c9f3898dbc99b8

1. **Meds that last longer:** Cialis lasts for a day or two, or there's a lower dose that he can take every day, so he's always ready. 

1. **Meds that act faster:** u/ShaktiAmarantha frequently recommends Trimix because it is cheaper and faster than any of the other ED drugs and has no side-effects.  It takes about 5 minutes for full effect.

3. **A cock ring or cock strap:** They're cheap, so you can experiment, and this may be all he needs to get and stay hard. See [the SO30 Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/sexover30mods/wiki/) for an article by u/CockringBuddha for info on getting started.

4. **Sex that doesn't require an erection:** There's so much you can do without a hard-on and, as others have said, men do NOT need an erection to have an orgasm.

5. **Make foreplay last longer:** There's no reason he can't just take a pill at the start of spontaneous sex and then spend half an hour making you feel incredibly well loved and cherished and giving you all the orgasms you can stand! :)

Also, you can combine some of these.  E.g., cock rings work really well with ED meds, helping reduce the dose required, and even if the CR doesn't give him a full erection, it can get him to 90% and make it easier to for you give him a BJ or HJ.

If he's willing to learn some basic forms of stress reduction, that can also help a lot with ED.  Dartmouth University's wellness website has a collection of audio files that will talk him through through several different approaches: [Relaxation Downloads](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~healthed/relax/downloads.html).

I would also recommend getting [a good, inexpensive massage table](https://www.amazon.com/Portable-featured-economical-available-anywhere/dp/B00K0OW60I/), a couple of big towels, and some coconut oil.  Full-body erotic massage is wonderful for options #4 and 5.  (See [Shakti's website](http://moderntantra.blogspot.com/2013/09/welcome-to-extraordinary-passion.html) for detailed instructions.) And you can use the table for [Sensate Focus Therapy](https://counselling-matters.org.uk/sites/counselling-matters/files/SensateFocus.pdf), which is one of the best ways to cure performance anxiety.

I had a lifelong plucking grey for a long time.  
[First, definitely check with your avian vet and go with what he/she says.]

Judging by the rough edges of the grey feathers bordering the bald patch, it looks like overpreening/shredding/plucking.  Again, just going by the pictures,
your bird's feather's look a bit dull (not glossy).  You may want to get some red palm oil and add it to his pellets, Greys seek the oil out in nature.  Also, if you don't have one, you may want to get a [bird UV light to help your bird get UV rays necessary to properly convert vitamin D](https://www.amazon.com/Zoo-Med-AvianSun-Deluxe-Floor/dp/B006L49LHC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482979024&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=bird+uv+light).  Make sure you get the BIRD bulb and not the reptile bulb.  

If you don't have one already, get a suction-cup shower perch and thoroughly shower-soak your bird 3 or more times a week in the shower with a shower perch and lukewarm water (just water no soap or additives). After shower, use 100% Pure Aloe Vera Juice $10/gal at Walgreens and a small cosmetic misting bottle. After the shower mist your entire bird, it helps with skin and reduces pin-feather irritation.

The spritzer bottle I use is super small, probably 3-4"" tall, fits in the palm of the hand so only the nozzle is visible under the thumb, e.g. http://www.quietfiredesign.com/byhandproducts/rubberaccess/spritzerbottle.jpg. It's also not a very powerful sprits more of a light mist, you'd be suprized what a great job it does of misting a bird in about 2-3 mins.

Plucking greys require HIGH PROTEIN because they tend to try to replace feathers faster. We feed Harrison's High Protein Course and Volkmann's Super Hookbill (GREAT SEEDS w/o Sunflower). Fresh greens and pastas (in moderation) are good to add too.

Make sure your bird has a bunch of interesting toys and perch options.  If you haven't yet found them, check out California Bird Nerds (they're closed until Jan). They sell crinkled cut colored paper strips, perfect for stuffing into cardboard boxes with any number of nic-nacs. Every cardboard box you get becomes a cheap new bird toy. A huge bag is $10-15 and it's great fun. You can see it all over the bottom of Ollie's cage in this photo: https://i.sli.mg/4ZJmZM.jpg.

Enrichment activities and planning your bird's time is pretty important with pluckers.  You can leave a radio on a talk station at a low volume in the room while you're gone.  I like to leave a laptop near Ollie's cage playing videos  of greys, [Whiskey being Whiskey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWSj02uIJW4) is a good place to start and I'll just let the video run from there.

The specific area your bird seems to be overfocusing on is the typical allopreening area, and may be an indication of wanting more socialization and touch.  [Here's a great guide from the Gabriel Foundation](http://thegabrielfoundation.org/caregivers-guide-touching-birds/).

Another thing that may be worth evaluating is how much of your living space your bird has access to and how often your bird goes different places in your space and what it means.  Does he spend all of his time in the cage?  Is he fully flighted?  Do you have an Upstairs/Downstairs--if so how does he move around the space and on what schedules?  Changing that up can have a big effect on helping your bird feel a more expansive experience within your home.   Is there a window he can see out of?  What's his view of the world outside?

If she's [Aviator Harness Trained](https://theparrotuniversity.com/content/aviator-bird-harness), taking her on a walk through the neighborhood is another great way to combine enriching experiences with the proper establishment of mutual respect.  Harness training is one of the best things you can do for your CAG! Opens up so many experiences. For travelling, [the Pak-O-Bird (Kinda pricey but worth it) is great, but keep an eye on it, even with the Congo-Grey protection they can still damage the zipper](https://www.celltei.com/products/pak-o-bird-modified-medium-for-congo-african-greys.html).

Another strong recommendation is work in weighing your bird several times a week. My routine is open the door, step-up, ""Let's check your WEIGHT!"" He steps down on the scale's perch (typically he'll poop here which is convenient). Again, check my post history. But knowing your bird's expected weight and having a sense of acceptable fluctuation is one of the best indicators of health. 

If you haven't tried it yet, you might want to check out ""Captive Foraging"" Harrison's sponsored putting it online for free: http://www.harrisonsbirdfoods.com/captive-foraging-video-watch-it-here-for-free/
It's basically a bunch of ideas for hiding food from your bird and making them work to eat like they would in the wild.

GOOD LUCK!

It is my bible. I go back to it again and again for vocabulary and technique. I forget why I bought the older one, I think some blog told me the newer version is not as good. 

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1ztfF0-cd4VX27ItjMoGEg
This blog has tutorials for every technique. This woman is my sewing guardian angel, she has the best videos. I wouldn't be able to sew without her. Basically when I started sewing I watched her video before beginning any new step i didn't know. Stitch in the ditch, watched her video, then did it. Hemming, watched her video then did it. Putting in a zipper, watched her video then did it.

Scissors, get a good pair of these: https://www.amazon.com/Gingher-01-005106-Lightweight-Trimmers-9-Inch/dp/B0001DUPB0/ref=sr_1_31?s=arts-crafts&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1471039933&amp;sr=1-31&amp;keywords=gingher+scissors

You'll need to start with:
Pins: just buy silk ones with glass heads, they're like $10, but worth it

Measuring tape 60"": should be like 1 or 2 dollars

hand sewing needles

sewing machine needles: you'll get a couple with your machine, but use a new one for every project

bobbins: make sure they're the right ones for your machine

seam ripper: get the best one you can find, it will be your biggest ally,

Pin cushion: just a basic tomato one will do, but there are cute cactus ones now that you can make: http://www.abeautifulmess.com/2015/07/cactus-pincushion-diy.html

a good iron: you probably have a bomb one right now, but upgrade if you're still on your $15 black and decker model

invisible marker/ water soluble market: better than tailors chalk, i have a double sided marker

a magnet: to pick up dropped pins (good to have especially at first) any kind will do. 

Anytime I start a new garment that I'm not sure about the technique or fit, I make a muslin. Basically a 1st draft with cheap $2 a yard fabric, and then I have the fit and techniques down before I do the real thing. 

Start with just making square pillows, then a duvet cover, then pillow cases. Then a pleated skirt. 

I prefer McCalls patterns, I generally like their fit and they aren't overly complicated while still being stylish. Like this one: https://mccallpattern.mccall.com/m7253
I usually order my patterns online when there's a sale. There's not a great place to buy patterns in the city, but if you're in Princeton and there's a Joann's nearby you can find them there usually on sale. Don't ever pay full price for patterns, they go on sale like every month, and go from like $20 to $4.

Most important thing is that sizing is completely different. I'm usually a size 12 in patterns, they're more akin to British sizes, but you just match your measurement, for a skirt, your waist, and match that measurement to the patterns sizing.

One more thing: Numbers would look even brighter if there was a clear path for these people to actually gain citizenship and contribute to the country legally.

The hardware isn't too difficult to set up, here's the part list I used:

 - [3-gang electrical wall box](https://www.lowes.com/pd/CARLON-44-cu-in-3-Gang-Plastic-New-Work-Wall-Electrical-Box/50011802)
 - light switch
 - 2x [dual wall outlet](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Cooper-Wiring-Devices-10-Pack-15-Amp-125-Volt-White-Indoor-Duplex-Wall-Outlet/1099255)

 - cheap phone charger (for 5V power supply to relay board, this can be omitted if you supply 5V to the relays from the RPi, but too many relays could potentially overwhem the RPi, and I have 12 relays connected right now, so each set of 4 has their own cheap 5V supply)
 - assorted wires to connect relay board to RPi
 - assorted wires (of appropriate gauge) to connect AC mains to relays/outlets
 - if not embedding in the wall, one of [these](http://p.globalsources.com/IMAGES/PDT/BIG/870/B1031396870.jpg) to allow an easy way to supply mains power to the relay box

For wiring any mains power yourself, make sure you know what you're doing. Messing with Arduino/RPi-style hobby electronics is one thing, but making a mistake with wiring mains power can cause property damage, injury, or death. Here's what I did:

AC neutral connects directly to outlets, and one prong of the 5V power supply. AC line connects to switch, and switch connects to 5V power supply, and normally open of relays. Common of relays connects to outlets. Make sure that you don't switch line and neutral. Some people who don't know better will claim that both leads are the same in AC mains, since it's AC, but that's FALSE. Neutral normally connects to earth ground at your main electrical panel, but line obviously does not, as that would be insane. Line is the smaller prong in US-style plugs, and neutral is the larger one. Also, make sure you connect earth ground to everything appropriate (the switches, outlets). All of this applies to the standard 120V, single-phase AC as used in North America.

As for connecting to the PI, each of these relay boxes needs a ground connection, 4 gpios, and a 5V if you're not using a separate power supply for the relays. Then, some software to drive them. My code is at [here](https://github.com/VectorCell/power-relays), where I have a command-line utility called ""relays"" that I used for scripting and such, and a web interface for controlling them from my phone, tablet, etc.

There's probably better and easier to follow guides out there, just google ""rasbperry pi relays' and you should find some stuff. [Here's](http://www.instructables.com/id/Web-Controlled-8-Channel-Powerstrip/) one of the guides that I used as a reference when I was building mine.",8,,VectorCell,,,2016,12,2016-12-04T22:04:52,t5_2ubz7,0,homelab,http://reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/5gfhuo/c/dasdo1l,947d3c0522dc94ff428185210ea1941afd9892dbae07b5fc1b0ebc1cbe57c6ac

But does that mean that, for example, I'm not allowed to protest against injustice? Or that I'm not allowed to talk with my girlfriend about the problems of our relationship?

No -- not that reality.

People suffer, not because they don't accept reality, because they are ignorant of it.   Maybe once they start to get a clue Hagen's statement applies in that they may not accept reality.

""Reality"" here referring to desire/attachment causing dissatisfaction, there not being a self, soul or persisting identity, that all things are impermanent,  that karma exists, that we are responsible for it, we are the heirs our actions, that we, everyone we know will grow old, get sick, and die.   There are more.

The ""Reality"" Hagen refers to isn't the mundane reality of your examples, but refers to what life is about, what is really going, especially the unpleasant parts we pretend doesn't exist.

After you finish this book you want to get a copy of the book of another introduction to Buddhism called:

[""What The Buddha Taught""](http://www.amazon.com/What-Buddha-Taught-Walpola-Rahula/dp/9559219197/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1443635685&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=what+the+buddha+taught) by Walpoa Rahula ( a Buddhist Monk )

It is written in very **clear** language and it is very **short**. 

Despite being short (151 pages) it covers all of the most important teachings very well.

There are several major types of Buddhism and the teachings covered in this book are common to many of the different types of Buddhism out there.

""What The Buddha Taught""  is old enough to be in many libraries and used book venues.

If none of those options exist there is a free [PDF](http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~buddhism/docs/Bhante_Walpola_Rahula-What_the_Buddha_Taught.pdf) version of the book that you can read.

If you're looking for more resources, I can think of a few resources to supplement what you're already reading/doing

**The Tangled Web** -  https://www.amazon.com/Tangled-Web-Securing-Modern-Applications/dp/1593273886 

**SQL Injection Attacks and Defense** - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1597494240

**Hacking Exposed: Web Application** - https://www.amazon.com/HACKING-EXPOSED-WEB-APPLICATIONS-Edition/dp/0071740643/

https://pentesterlab.com/bootcamp - At this point, you can probably filter out what's relevant to you or not, this will map out other topics related to what you need to know, and may fill in any gaps you have at this point.

**OWASP** - https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page [Borderline vital to web app exploitation, Highly recommend if you haven't explored this site yet]

Now, the books and study materials are nice and all, but the most important thing is practical experience, and I see you've identified that by engaging yourself in DVWA. A few additional hands on labs you could dive into are vulnhubs that target the web (Broken Web Applications Project by OWASP is a must):

https://www.vulnhub.com/?q=Web&amp;sort=date-asc&amp;type=vm

**Wargames (Overthewire / Smashthestack)**:

http://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/

**SecurityInnovation (canyouhack.us)**:

http://canyouhack.us/  - It will start off with web challenges, feel free to stop when it starts getting into binary exploitation. What you've learned up to this point should carry you through the web application portion of this challenge, although some lateral thinking is required, which is also a skill you'll need for the GWAPT.

**Google-Gruyere** - https://google-gruyere.appspot.com/

Since you stated that you were going through the WAHH book, the labs over at mdsec may be a good investment for you at this point to follow along (although not exactly required if you properly use the resources above)

http://mdsec.net/labs/

https://www.wechall.net/challs - Again, filter out what you need to practice here. Lots of good challenges for multiple different areas of study.

**CTF's**: Be on the lookout for CTF's on http://ctftime.org and put a focus on the web challenges. These challenges will encourage lateral thinking like the securityinnovation challenge. 
http://shell-storm.org/repo/CTF/ is an archive of older CTF's if you're having a hard time finding upcoming CTF's with good web exploitation sections. In my opinion, CSAW is especially good when it comes to web challenges, but check most of them out if you get time.

Another recommendation to you is to develop a decent understanding of how a web application is structured. It becomes easier to visualize how to attack a web application, when you can engineer one. So I will recommend that you learn:

**HTML/CSS** - don't spend way too much time on this, codecademy should suffice here 

**Javascript**: The source of the client side exploits you will find in the future. Get your feet wet in javascript via codecademy, and progress further.

**PHP**: Source of the majority of server side exploits you will find (RFI/LFI, SQL Injection, etc). As with javascript, get your feet wet through codecademy, and try to progress further from there. 

**SQL**: Important to know for SQL Injection. PHP is responsible for the implementation that leads to SQL Injection, but you should really know SQL to actually manipulate the DBMS to your needs.

With the web languages I listed, the end goal for you, should be to identify vulnerable source code, as well as being able to intentionally develop vulnerable source code, and fix it. 

At this point, you should be relatively comfortable with the concepts covered in the GWAPT, however if not, take a look at the bulletin/syllabus of the actual exam, and individually research each topic.

http://www.giac.org/certification/web-application-penetration-tester-gwapt

Looking at the syllabus for the actual course that maps to GWAPT may provide some insight as well.

If you're looking for just a Type C battery that doesn't support USB PD, there are plenty from good brands like Anker, Aukey, and Tronsmart that support the standard 15W (5V/3A) charging. Just look on Amazon.

Edit:    
Found another, though it is apparently no longer available. Like I said, limited market right now.

You should get one for your operating system in general anyways, poe aside. Its by far the single biggest performance increase most computers will get if you havent got one already.

They also dont need to be too expensive (this statement is obviously dependent on perspective!) 

$90 gets you a 250GB ssd and add another $10 for a sata 3 cable and a SSD mounting bracket and it brings the total to 100.

The Samsung ones come software which makes it very easy to move over your OS from your old HDD and 250GB is more than enough to save your read/write dependent software (operating system and path of exile and other favorite games). You can keep your old HDD installed for storing other media files.

They are also very easy to install. Your power supplies cable very likely has a dual SATA/peripheral power cable so just plug the power connector which is likely dangling from your existing HDD into the SSD and plug in the SATA3 cable to connect the SSD to a socket on your mobo (one of the sockets where your existing HDD is plugged in).

Trust me, you want one.

Now, the books and study materials are nice and all, but the most important thing is practical experience, and I see you've identified that by engaging yourself in DVWA. A few additional hands on labs you could dive into are vulnhubs that target the web (Broken Web Applications Project by OWASP is a must):

https://www.vulnhub.com/?q=Web&amp;sort=date-asc&amp;type=vm

**SecurityInnovation (canyouhack.us)**:

What you've learned up to this point should carry you through the web application portion of this challenge, although some lateral thinking is required, which is also a skill you'll need for the GWAPT.

**Google-Gruyere** - https://google-gruyere.appspot.com/

Since you stated that you were going through the WAHH book, the labs over at mdsec may be a good investment for you at this point to follow along (although not exactly required if you properly use the resources above)

http://mdsec.net/labs/

https://www.wechall.net/challs - Again, filter out what you need to practice here. Lots of good challenges for multiple different areas of study.

**CTF's**: Be on the lookout for CTF's on http://ctftime.org and put a focus on the web challenges. These challenges will encourage lateral thinking like the securityinnovation challenge. 
http://shell-storm.org/repo/CTF/ is an archive of older CTF's if you're having a hard time finding upcoming CTF's with good web exploitation sections. In my opinion, CSAW is especially good when it comes to web challenges, but check most of them out if you get time.

Another recommendation to you is to develop a decent understanding of how a web application is structured. It becomes easier to visualize how to attack a web application, when you can engineer one. So I will recommend that you learn:

**HTML/CSS** - don't spend way too much time on this, codecademy should suffice here 

**Javascript**: The source of the client side exploits you will find in the future. Get your feet wet in javascript via codecademy, and progress further.

**PHP**: Source of the majority of server side exploits you will find (RFI/LFI, SQL Injection, etc). As with javascript, get your feet wet through codecademy, and try to progress further from there. 

**SQL**: Important to know for SQL Injection. PHP is responsible for the implementation that leads to SQL Injection, but you should really know SQL to actually manipulate the DBMS to your needs.

With the web languages I listed, the end goal for you, should be to identify vulnerable source code, as well as being able to intentionally develop vulnerable source code, and fix it. 

At this point, you should be relatively comfortable with the concepts covered in the GWAPT, however if not, take a look at the bulletin/syllabus of the actual exam, and individually research each topic.

All the mods in the world won't help if you are broken down. Find out what is causing your CEL and get it fixed. 

The bouncy ride is likely due to bad/worn out shocks. Replace them with higher quality parts. You can get Monroe load adjusting rear shocks (look like coil overs) for [about $90](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000C53RXK/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) for both. They are helpful for fighting rear end sag when you are loaded up. There are a lot of options for the front shocks depending on what kind of ride you prefer. 

If your shocks were neglected, your other suspension components might be used up too. Replace the upper control arms, lower ball joints, tie rod ends, and might as well check the brakes too. Check to make the bearings in your wheel hubs aren't worn out either. If you can't stop or a wheel falls off, you will be in rough shape. 

Change all of your fluids too if you can. This includes your differentials, transfer case, engine oil, trans, and coolant. You never know when the last time some of those have been changed, or what kind of condition the oil/fluid is in until you check. Test your battery or replace it if it is over 5 years old. 

As far as mods go, start off with the basics. Get good tires that are designed for off road use, not passenger rated street tires. You can fit 31x10.5r15 tires with no problems or modification needed. Your tire choice will vary depending on the terrain you most often travel on and budget. Because of the 4wd system in your v8 explorer, you should also get a spare in the same size as your other tires. If you do get a flat, you can burn out drivetrain components because the smaller spare has to spin more than the larger tires in order to cover the same distance. 

If you do want a slight lift, you can crank your torsion bar adjusting bolts in the front for a 1.5"" gain. Any more than that and you will be putting too much strain on your cv joints. You will need to get an alignment after a torsion twist though. However, if you are replacing your ball joints and other front end parts too, you'll need to get an alignment anyway. For the back, you can buy a set of longer shackles [(Warrior 153)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017M6F2W/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) that connect the rear part of your springs to the frame. That should get you about 2"" more clearance in the back. You can also use an add a leaf spring to help bring the rear up more. An add a leaf will make your ride much more stiff in the rear though. If you have running boards, remove them for more clearance as well. 

Set up proper recovery points in the front and rear. There aren't any good places to pull from stock, and you don't want to go breaking anything while you are trying to get out of a mess in the middle of nowhere. Also, check to make sure you have the factory fuel tank skid plate. It isn't 1/4"" laser cut steel, but it is better than nothing. If you don't have one, look in a local junk yard. 

You might want to get some new headlight housings too. They tend to fog and not do much at all. They are easy enough to replace and will make a huge difference on and off road. Auxiliary lights like Hellas, KCs, or maybe a lightbar will be very helpful if you find yourself off-road in the dark very often. Most of these aux lights come in a kit complete with a relay, fuse, switch, and a wiring harness. Installation is pretty straight forward and can be done well in a few hours (even if you have never done any electrical work before).

Other than that, just get out and enjoy the process of figuring out what you really need from your vehicle. Learn proper recovery techniques and always go with another vehicle if you can. Always pack emergency gear like a first aid kit, extra clothes, food, water, flashlight, and a handful of tools for quick fixes. You might find that you need a winch, awning, rtt, storage drawers, dual batteries, and full armor eventually, but it is better to build as you go to find out what is really necessary for you.

There are not a ton of aftermarket modifications for second gen Explorers, so you might have to do some custom work (or find someone who can do it for you). I'd advise that you do as much of the maintenance on your own as you can. That way if something fails, you will know where to begin troubleshooting and will hopefully be able to fix it. If you haven't already found it, [ExplorerForum.com](http://www.explorerforum.com/forums/index.php?categories/1995-2001-explorer-ranger-mountaineer.92/) is a VERY helpful place.

You never know when the last time some of those have been changed, or what kind of condition the oil/fluid is in until you check. Test your battery or replace it if it is over 5 years old. 

As far as mods go, start off with the basics. Get good tires that are designed for off road use, not passenger rated street tires. You can fit 31x10.5r15 tires with no problems or modification needed. Your tire choice will vary depending on the terrain you most often travel on and budget. Because of the 4wd system in your v8 explorer, you should also get a spare in the same size as your other tires. If you do get a flat, you can burn out drivetrain components because the smaller spare has to spin more than the larger tires in order to cover the same distance. 

If you do want a slight lift, you can crank your torsion bar adjusting bolts in the front for a 1.5"" gain. Any more than that and you will be putting too much strain on your cv joints. You will need to get an alignment after a torsion twist though. However, if you are replacing your ball joints and other front end parts too, you'll need to get an alignment anyway. For the back, you can buy a set of longer shackles [(Warrior 153)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017M6F2W/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) that connect the rear part of your springs to the frame. That should get you about 2"" more clearance in the back. You can also use an add a leaf spring to help bring the rear up more. An add a leaf will make your ride much more stiff in the rear though. If you have running boards, remove them for more clearance as well. 

Set up proper recovery points in the front and rear. There aren't any good places to pull from stock, and you don't want to go breaking anything while you are trying to get out of a mess in the middle of nowhere. Also, check to make sure you have the factory fuel tank skid plate. It isn't 1/4"" laser cut steel, but it is better than nothing. If you don't have one, look in a local junk yard. 

You might want to get some new headlight housings too. They tend to fog and not do much at all. They are easy enough to replace and will make a huge difference on and off road. Auxiliary lights like Hellas, KCs, or maybe a lightbar will be very helpful if you find yourself off-road in the dark very often. Most of these aux lights come in a kit complete with a relay, fuse, switch, and a wiring harness. Installation is pretty straight forward and can be done well in a few hours (even if you have never done any electrical work before).

Other than that, just get out and enjoy the process of figuring out what you really need from your vehicle. Learn proper recovery techniques and always go with another vehicle if you can. Always pack emergency gear like a first aid kit, extra clothes, food, water, flashlight, and a handful of tools for quick fixes. You might find that you need a winch, awning, rtt, storage drawers, dual batteries, and full armor eventually, but it is better to build as you go to find out what is really necessary for you.

There are not a ton of aftermarket modifications for second gen Explorers, so you might have to do some custom work (or find someone who can do it for you). I'd advise that you do as much of the maintenance on your own as you can. That way if something fails, you will know where to begin troubleshooting and will hopefully be able to fix it. If you haven't already found it, [ExplorerForum.com](http://www.explorerforum.com/forums/index.php?categories/1995-2001-explorer-ranger-mountaineer.92/) is a VERY helpful place.

Most of this is totally unrealistic. The idea of a ""power chip"" is to store up your grudges and then dump them on your partner later. This is very toxic and I strongly advise against it. 

I would also advise against the open/3way. That sort of relationship is based on open communication, boundaries and respecting your partner's  boundaries. The cheating shows she hasn't done so. You need a lot more open and respectful dialog before going there (the book *Ethical Slut* is a pretty good intro to polyamory and open relationships).  

The following 2 books are written by women who had been married to men, and then came out to themselves. They're written *for women* - to let them know that she's not the only ones to go through this. I recommend that you read one or more of these.  So you get an idea of what she's going through and what you should be expecting. They're mainly written for women who feel guilty that their marriage is breaking up. 

[Dear John, I love Jane](http://www.amazon.com/Dear-John-Love-Jane-Leaving/dp/1580053394/) (recommended you read this first) and   
[Living Two Lives](http://www.amazon.com/Living-Two-Lives-Married-Woman/dp/1461177464/).  

&gt; *What bothers me is that she's my wife and sneaking around and investing herself in someone else behind my back. I might have even been cool with it if she'd been upfront, asked my thoughts, and let me be a part of it.*   

The cheating is what you should be worried about. You are correct to be bothered. The idea of threesomes is not realistic - probably the idea came from watching too much porn. 

&gt; *if you pick up a girl can I watch you two from the corner?*  

This is really bad. Ultra bad. I'd recommend never saying it again. Especially if you're drunk. It is a hotbutton issue that will make most lesbians very angry. *Vein in the forehead throbbing so loud you can see it across the room* angry. Think of it as something you say to break up your friendship without effort. 

&gt; *I was the wife's first sexual partner and she comes from a very traditional and strict family.*   

It is common for women from such families to take decades (and multiple marriages) to come out to themselves. Don't try to guilt-trip her into staying. Don't buy a house together. Do hold off on having children (at least until this is worked out). 

It is possible that after discussions the two of you are willing to have some sort of open relationship. If she *is* a lesbian, it is not reasonable to expect her to stay in a monogamous hetero relationship with you. If she is bisexual, it is reasonable to expect her to stay in a monogamous hetero relationship with you. It is possible that the two of you want to have children in such a relationship. It can be done, you two have to work the details out. 

Two of my exes came out as lesbians. If they had wanted kids, I would have tried to figure some way to make it work (I have chronic baby rabies). 

Advice: read the 2 books. Sit down with her and have a heart-to-heart conversation. Be prepared to get divorced.

Yes, with the Zhumell's 9mm kit eyepiece you'll get 133x. You require 50x or so to recognize details on Jupiter/Saturn/Mars. Of course seeing is a limiting factor.

Usually it's brightest moons show up as a chain of small dots, even at much lower magnification. So you should recognize Jupiter even in the 30mm eyepiece.

(edit: Also, the moon filter might reduce glare / help you see some details, but either way: Patience. They are faint)

A decent(!) 6mm will of course give you better views.

300x or even 400x will work, but atmospheric seeing often won't allow more than 200x-250x.

There is a really good book on this called [Facts Can't Speak for Themselves](https://www.amazon.com/Facts-Cant-Speak-Themselves-Stories/dp/1556817908/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482779072&amp;sr=8-3-fkmr0&amp;keywords=facts+can+speak+for+themselves) by the nationally known and respected jury consultant Eric Oliver. 

His theory is that we are hardwired for story telling and that we have to frame facts that can be conveyed in a narrative manner that touches the stories that people have internally. It is a method for tapping into a type of confirmation bias. Essentially, framing facts in a narrative in such a way that we are preaching to the choir even if they disagree with us. But, you have to listen to discover the song they are singing.

I think if we all learn to listen more to discover the stories that people have internally, it opens a door to communicate with people through story telling to get our points across no matter what it is. 

Most people operate in an analysis fact free world and make decisions based on the narratives they have constructed from personal experience. This is a mental shortcut in all of our brains that allow us to survive and not drown in the incredible amounts of data we experience from birth to death. It allows us to survive by deciding what is an immediate issue, like the danger of rattle snake right next to you rather than a lion half a mile away.

Then the use of language is how we survive as a group by relating stories to other people. Those stories propagate and rise in importance in how is is perceived to aid in survival. If we can connect and share experiences, we can move people in our direction.

I funded a Kickstarter for the [""Tic Watch 2""](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mobvoi/ticwatch-2-the-most-interactive-smartwatch) which made me realize the potential for a smartwatch.

The watch is currently running 5 complications on the modular face:

* [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/app/)
* [PokemonGo](http://pokemongolive.com/en/post/apple-watch/)

This woven band is a lot more comfortable than the one from AliExpress.  I'm curious to see how the band holds up to wear-and-tear since it is softer.

* [Classic Leather Band](http://www.monoweardesign.com/leather-band/?mwc=brown) from Monowear for $39.99.  You know the saying ""you get what you pay for"" well, this is incredibly obvious between the two leather bands.  The leather is both softer and appears to be a lot higher quality than the cheap version from AliExpress. I am excited to see how it turns out once it is worn in (9/10)

His theory is that we are hardwired for story telling and that we have to frame facts that can be conveyed in a narrative manner that touches the stories that people have internally. It is a method for tapping into a type of confirmation bias. Essentially, framing facts in a narrative in such a way that we are preaching to the choir even if they disagree with us. But, you have to listen to discover the song they are singing.

I think if we all learn to listen more to discover the stories that people have internally, it opens a door to communicate with people through story telling to get our points across no matter what it is. 

Most people operate in an analysis fact free world and make decisions based on the narratives they have constructed from personal experience. This is a mental shortcut in all of our brains that allow us to survive and not drown in the incredible amounts of data we experience from birth to death. It allows us to survive by deciding what is an immediate issue, like the danger of rattle snake right next to you rather than a lion half a mile away.

Then the use of language is how we survive as a group by relating stories to other people. Those stories propagate and rise in importance in how is is perceived to aid in survival. If we can connect and share experiences, we can move people in our direction.

 Tiny Houses Built with Recycled Materials: Inspiration for Constructing Tiny Homes Using Salvaged and Reclaimed Supplies

&gt;salvaging old campers for their propane fridge/stove combo. 

Personally I am forgoing RV appliances completely.  If you choose to use solar power you will have to wire your home for DC and AC electric, and to use less watts choose new appliances after 1993. Once household appliance manufacturers had to disclose how much energy an appliance consumed all of a sudden the appliance use of electric was cut in half.

While I am building I plan to use a friend's yurt to live in and have an outdoor kitchen/bathroom.  So possibly you could use the combo for a while after the Tiny house is built until you have the interior finished!

Keep in mind RV appliances were designed and built for a couple weeks of use a year and regular household appliances were designed to be used 52 days a year.

In regards to buying salvaged products you don't have to salvage the material yourself: https://www.habitat.org/donate/?link=271&amp;source_code=DHQOW1407W1GGR&amp;iq_id=61484080-VQ6-81398378715-VQ16-c&amp;gclid=CLiKvvmqmtECFcq2wAodXhMFAQ  habitat for humanity resell store in your state, find it.

Tiny House Floor Plans: Over 200 Interior Designs for Tiny Houses Paperback – February 22, 2012

https://www.amazon.com/Tiny-House-Design-Construction-Guide/dp/0997288701/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483046655&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=tiny+house+construction+and+design I found the page which the floor plan outlines and the cut outs for furniture, printed them on transparencies and have it taped to my desk.  If you are planning to use salvage materials have 4 prototypes planned to the hilt and have those plans in sketchup http://www.sketchup.com/download  have two alternative plans that are very vague and not built to use as parts of the building you can swap out with the other 4 plans.

Most states require you to have a primary dwelling started (think septic tank and foundation for a house) then your Tiny house can be your accessory dwelling. 

For wiring which might complicated if you choose to use solar: http://thetinylife.com/shockingly-simple-electrical-for-tiny-houses/  that will help. 

Then another of Ryan Mitchell's books: http://thetinylife.com/cracking-the-code-updated/


I hope this helps.  setting aside 2 years to plan and research before starting would be an excellent idea.

Selling tops and bottoms separately is a pretty common practice- a lot of times brands sell the same pattern swimsuit in multiple designs so that you can choose each piece independently and still have them match.

Basically you need to prioritize what matters for you when you go into your treatment.  With a child at home I would think that a high probability treatment method would take precedence over finances.   But if you have an aggressive form of cancer with a lower probability of curing, it sounds like you will have substantially different priorities than most Americans (and that's a good thing IMO.)

You'll want to maximize quality of life for as long as possible while allowing you to continue to support your family and spend time with your child.  Your treatment plan should be based around this, rather than throwing everything you can at the cancer hoping for a miracle.

&gt;X-MEN Reading List

&gt;Here are some popular X-Men books and related titles from Marvel:

&gt;The Dark Phoenix Saga by Chris Claremont and John Byrne

&gt;X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills by Chris Claremont and Brent Anderson

&gt;New X-Men by Grant Morrison

&gt;X-Force/X-Statix by Peter Milligan and Michael Allred

&gt;**Astonishing X-Men by Joss Whedon and John Cassaday**

&gt;New Mutants by Zeb Wells

&gt;Uncanny X-Force by Rick Remender

&gt;X-Factor by Peter David

&gt;X-Men Legacy by Mike Carey

&gt;All-New X-Men by Brian Michael Bendis, Stuart Immonen, Wade Von Grawbadger, and Marte Gracia

Personally, I'd strongly recommend [Whedon's Astonishing X-Men](https://www.amazon.com/Astonishing-Whedon-Cassaday-Ultimate-Collection/dp/0785161945/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1481296695&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=astonishing+x-men) to any new reader.

If it's JUST Wolverine you're interested in, [the Wolverine run by Jason Aaron](https://www.amazon.com/Wolverine-Jason-Aaron-Collection-Unnumbered/dp/0785185410) is a pretty fun jumping on point.

I haven't tried OBDII on it, but I'm pretty sure they support it. Reverse camera works well, and works even before the unit finishes booting. Below is the summary of my experience.

Performance:

The unit performs pretty well and has decent a decent DAC/amplifier. I believe they have a 24bit DAC in it, and I haven't run into issues with the amplifier. It boots in the typical 25-30s, which seems like a while (and it is), but it's usually done booting by the time my garage door finishes closing. The unit may have some lag or touch issues once it first boots up, but in general it's pretty snappy.

For maps, I used Sygic, and it works well for offline maps and navigation. I tried other solutions before by Sygics was the best solution I found. Google maps is too limited in what you can download, and some apps just flat out don't work in landscape. Sygic let's me download anything I want, and the interface is pretty good. 

Installation:

The install was pretty easy, and it turned out okay, but it wasn't perfect by any means.

This unit does NOT require an adapter as it is already 10mm wider than the standard double DIN (just like the OEM unit). Most wires were plug and play, but I had to splice wires for the remote amp turn on and reverse camera signals. You will also need an adapter for the antenna.

The final finish is pretty good, but the unit is shallower than the OEM unit. As a consequence, the back side of the silver trim was pushing on the head unit; you can't push the trim all the way in, and the head unit's trim won't be flush with the glove compartment's trim. The solution, which may seem scary, is to sand down the part of the trim that you can't see. Once the trim is no longer pushing on the head unit, everything will install flush, and no one will be the wiser.",7,,yellowelbow,,,2016,12,2016-12-18T16:27:34,t5_2t4rq,0,ft86,http://reddit.com/r/ft86/comments/5j0l3d/c/dbcfhl0,d551b705d96a7fbb6a85634aa4c3a5809f75eedc818a43110c5f0e6e15ebc5e8

This is because such a function associates to each value of x only one value of y, whereas a loop will (necessarily) have more than one value of y associated to some values of x. If we allow ourselves to work with equations that have multiple solutions for a fixed x value, the problem is more interesting. Let f(x, y) be some function taking in two numbers and spitting out one (for example, f(x, y) = x^2 + xy + y^2). The set of solutions in three-space to the equation z = f(x, y) is a surface. We can ""cut"" the surface at a certain level by considering only the values of x and y for which f(x, y) = c, where c is a constant. Plotting these values allows us much more freedom in the sorts of graphs we can plot. 

To answer your question a bit more directly, there is an important class of curves known as _elliptic curves_ (the elliptic part comes from their appearance in the integral computation of the perimeter of an ellipse). These curves are all points (x, y) satisfying y^2 = x^3 + ax + b, after some variable substitution. We call an elliptic curve _nodal_ if it intersects itself [transversely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transversality_(mathematics\)) at one point. Such a curve will appear to have a ""loop-de-loop"" in it. For example, the elliptic curve given by [y^2 = x^3 - 3x + 2](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=y%5E2+%3D+x%5E3+-+3x+%2B+2) has a loop in it! 

Sorry this dragged on so long; I hope it helped! For more information on elliptic curves, see John Tate and Joe Silverman's fantastic book [Rational Points on Elliptic Curves](https://www.amazon.com/Rational-Points-Elliptic-Undergraduate-Mathematics/dp/331918587X/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=WT211D4DZ01N7HQSMAJ2).

Mine takes about 3 quarts of oil.  I always fry outside so my entire loft doesn't smell like fryer grease for weeks.  Afterwards, I filter the cooled oil through cheese cloth on a strainer and store it in the fridge.  I get 2-3 uses per gallon of oil, depending on what I fry, how hot I need it, and how long I keep it heated.

You cannot fry something in oil without a thermometer and you have to keep changing the temp to compensate (it cools when you first plunge the food, but it rapidly rises once the moisture starts boiling off).  If the oil exceeds 400 F, you burn it and start to get a funky flavor, but more importantly you risk a [grease fire](http://img.wonderhowto.com/img/63/61/63532115586180/0/safely-put-out-grease-fire-and-prevent-them-altogether.w1456.jpg).

So I never fry anything in oil without using the temperature controlled deep fryer.  Food comes out better, it's safer, and my place doesn't stink like fast food for weeks.

While winter gear has gotten better in recent years, there's still no such thing as ""ultralight winter camping.""  You don't really think about ""how can I shed weight"" as much as you think about ""how do I stay alive; I'm willing to bring everything I need to do so regardless of weight.""  I've done trips in the winter where my pack weighed 75 pounds easily.  

/u/armchairbackpacker's comment about winter camping being a lot of camping and little hiking is also very true.  I find that, especially earlier on in the season, there's absolutely nothing I can do to tire myself out to the point that I sleep through the entire night while camping.  It's not uncommon that I'm asleep by 7 pm (at that point the suns been down for over 2 hours), and then wide awake by 3 am.  A good book is imperative for passing the long hours of darkness (especially on solo trips).  

Some answers to your specific questions:

I use a tarp year round for below treeline camping in the northeast (Adirondacks and occasionally the Whites).  It works by itself most of the time but every once in a while you want the bivy also, so I still carry one just in case.  

For winter camping, yeah, you definitely want a sleeping pad with an R-Value of at least 3.5.  4+ is better.  

I use a -20F bag for winter camping, but I also carry a Sea-to-Summit liner just in case of even colder temps.  The coldest I've been out in was -30F (on a trip in the Whites).  For Canada, which is further north, I would question how effective a 20F bag would be (even with a 40F to supplement it).  The conditions you're looking at sound similar to the Adirondacks, and I'd be pretty hesitant to try to use a similar setup myself.  I would strongly recommend that you look at quilts/bags designed for actual winter use.  

Additionally, for trips longer than 1 or 2 nights, a vapor barrier liner is imperative to prevent condensation from building up in the insulation of your sleeping bag over successive nights of use.  

For the conditions you're looking at, a canister stove will **NOT WORK** (bolded for emphasis because this is really important).  As the air temperature drops, the pressure in canisters drops as well.  There's some stoves designed to counter this (and some techniques that can be used to extend the usable temperature range, like sleeping with the canister to keep it warm) but even these aren't going to be enough to keep the stove usable in temperatures down below 10 or 15F.  White gas is really the only way to go for extreme cold weather camping if you want a reliable stove that won't crap out on you.  

Finding wood for a campfire, much less for a tinder stove, is a pretty involved process in winter as well.  The last thing you're going to want to do when you get to camp is spend an hour looking for wet wood that is buried beneath the snow, so even if they were usable, tinder stoves are definitely out.  

Melting snow for water is a lengthy, arduous process that consumes a lot of fuel.  You should fully expect this to take an hour or longer every evening, and for it to double your fuel consumption over what you would use without having to melt snow.  You'll also want to bring filter (bandana or similar) of some kind to filter out pine needles and sticks, etc.  

If I'm with a group, I'll usually bring two stoves so that cooking dinner and melting snow can happen concurrently.  

Unless you're climbing actual mountains, you'll probably be fine with a decent pair of snowshoes alone.  Most modern snowshoes have small built in crampon that suffices for most conditions.  

A few other thoughts.  

NOLS has a pretty good book on the subject that I highly recommend.  This is probably the single best reference on winter camping techniques and gear:  https://www.amazon.com/NOLS-Winter-Camping-Library/dp/0811731839

I'd also recommend getting your Wilderness First Aid certification.  WFA courses are easy to complete (typically 2 days and can be taken in a single weekend).  The knowledge you gain about early recognition of frost bite and especially hypothermia, as well as how to respond accordingly, is imperative for winter hiking and camping.

I'm still learning a lot but I've picked up a lot of tips. 

Youtube is a great place to start. There's lots of make-up channels. 

Use a primer, especially if you're going with a powder foundation, it helps everything set better imo.

I have dark beard shadow and color corrector has been a godsend. Depending on your skin tone, applying orange or like a salmon color before your foundation should help hide that immensely. I really like nyx for these. 
https://www.amazon.com/NYX-Cosmetics-Concealer-Orange-0-25/dp/B004QQ1170

If you have a friend you can trust have them help you find a foundation to match your skin tone unless you're confident you can figure it out. 

If you have masculine facial features a highlighting kit is your lifeline. It can really help mask things you want to cover and draw towards what you like. Again a friend who knows what they're doing really helps since every face is different, but you can get the gist online and stumble through. 

Idk if you plan on using lipstick, because I didn't care for it at first, but a little extra color really helps me pass. 

Eyeliner is still the hardest part for me. Like, I seriously think you just gotta practice and mess up a lot before it starts to click. Eventually your eyes will stop watering up, if they do now lol. You'll find stuff you like but it takes a lot of practice. Cis-girls have years on us lol.

I haven't done much with eyeshadow yet but find colors that work with your skin tone, lipstick whatever and make sure to blend them well.

If you have any more specific questions I'm happy to help however i can.

I am new to assembly as well, but after about 20 models I don't even sweat it.  Everyone on this sub swears by Tamiya liquid cement -- but I think this applicator is 100x better than the brush for most cases:

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006N6ODS/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1

Basically... take your time, clean up every little piece as it comes off the sprue, dry fit a few times to make sure.  It's not that hard, it just takes patience.  Sometimes I will sand+dry fit a piece a dozen times before it finally fits perfectly.  One thing that I didn't realize for a long time is these things aren't perfect -- sometimes a piece just doesn't fit and its up to you to fix it.  A couple of the hands on the Phoenix, for example, were real bastards for me.  A really great trick I learned randomly on youtube -- you can use the plastic cement as a kind of seam filler by putting slightly more glue than necessary, so it just barely squeezes out the side.  Then cut/sand any excess.

I also recommend grabbing a cheap seam scraper and a very nice sprue cutter (the clippers at home depot are not made for plastic).  Also maybe some tools for pinning -- for example, I had a resin base that I wanted to put my antelope on, so he had to be pinned to it rather than glued.

If you are going to paint your models, there's a few more things you should get -- a putty you like, some clay shapers, and some way to do some light sanding.",6,,Elltrain_,,,2016,12,2016-12-12T19:25:02,t5_2vzhk,0,KingdomDeath,http://reddit.com/r/KingdomDeath/comments/5hxvfo/c/db3y03k,1faffb7a007dc84d498db7c3fe432adb8231167790becdf46e0450ac9b2f5bd5

- Say they will ""definitely buy"" and don't actually when you present it to them.
- Will say nice things, biased answers not to hurt your feelings (even if they don't realize it).

What I advise :

1) **Read this**, it will help you define your customer need and products. Best 10$ you'll ever spend if you plan to launch a product and you are collecting feedback.
https://www.amazon.com/Mom-Test-customers-business-everyone/dp/1492180742
(NB : There might be other alternatives, @UX guys out there if you have another book to suggest)


2) **Launch a quick dummy store**.
Woocommerce, shopify,etc... are options to do so. Do a quick store setup with a them and few products and images and explanation, then add google analytics and track your funnel. Then do some fb and/or adwords campaigns to bring traffic in.
Do everything like you were selling the actual product and once people reached the checkout and are ready to pay redirect them to a page saying *""Sorry we are not open yet, enter your email adress here and we'll let you know as soon we are ready to ship""*


Once it's done, check the number of people that interacted, added your product to the cart, proceeded to checkout. You'll have an accurate view of the potential of your business.


I can tell you, best shit you can ever do. I've done it myself to test an idea. It's better than any business plan and you'll learn a ton of stuff in the process.",8,,lecanar,,,2016,12,2016-12-24T10:41:20,t5_2qldo,0,Entrepreneur,http://reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/5k2cye/c/dbkt1cj,7e8be22ace13fb6db0b859ae4a06f7db706551969cab28be73c93da47595de5d

1. Install Carbon Copy Cloner (they have 30 day trail).   [from here](https://bombich.com/)
2. With CCC create a clone of my Mac's HD to an external HD (I use a 2.5"" [WesternDigital My Passport Ultra 2TB](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E055H5O/ref=twister_B00EHFJGW2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;th=1) for that).   
3. I then upgrade to the new OS, if it turns out to be bad experience, I use the option key during boot up, and then boot from my external drive, at which point I use CCC again to now clone the external hard drive to my Mac's HD, essentially, I revert back to the state of the machine before the upgrade.   
   
Having said that, last and only time so far that I had to do this was when upgrading from 10.6.8 to 10.7, 10.7 was terrible for my system, but I am happy to report that 10.12 (Sierra) works just fine, same as all other versions I had on this machine (10.8/10.9/10.10/10.11).   
   
p.s.   
I am using a mid-2010 MBP 15""   
and..... ended up buying CCC, because its super handy, theres an option to ""update"" a clone, which means: copy whatever files that have changed since last backup, which is just perfect as it makes the clone drive up to date and doesn't take too long to do, meaning its not a annoying to backup - so you are more likely to keep it backed up - so in the event that you will need it... you will actually have it.

I'm not going to sit here and drop the usual cliche on how you can improve your life. I'm sure you heard it all before. I can only tell you that I know how you feel. My whole life I have been battling with mental health problems because of a fucked up childhood. I was only a kid when I first tried to end my life. I could never dream of a day where things would have gotten better for me.. but it did. There's no cookie-cutter solution I can give you that would immediately improve your life. We are all different and your particular outlook on life is a product of your own life experiences.

I know though my own experiences and interacting with others who were contemplating suicide that the main source of our angst is our own toxic mindset and loneliness. There is nothing wrong with you. Just to put it into context, if you were the same person you are now, but surrounded by many who adored and loved you, your outlook on life and yourself would be drastically different. In a way your validation of yourself and your life comes externally instead of from within. Because your life is void of many elements that you believe is needed to constitute a satisfying life you have come to the conclusion that it is not worth living.

If you believe race is a major contributor to your misery than remove race as a factor. Move to an Asian enclave where you are the majority and no one would give a second thought about your race. 

If your dead end job is reinforcing this perception of yourself of being a person of little value than find something that will give you fulfillment. It doesn't have to be something that brings you a shitload of money, but just something that you can be proud of or you enjoy doing. Heck, if you're seriously thinking about ending your life, go balls to the wall and start your own business on the side! It can be anything that you have interest in. With outsourcing (cheap labor), cloud, and the wealth of information online, you can start many businesses without much capital. At my gf's workplace there's this doctor who didn't become one until he was 45. It's never too late to pursue whatever you want if you have the drive and willingness. 

If past failed dating experiences have jaded your views on relationship than replace it with new experiences. The truth is, most of us have had bad experiences at one time or another. Most people in general make shitty partners. But don't let a few rotten apples prevent you from hopping on the horse and trying again. Download every dating apps you can think of, go on those dating meetups, or do whatever you have to do get your tip wet or find that true love if that's what you're looking for. There are just as many women out there who are single and nearing middle age/30s+ that are in desperate need of loving. For women it's even more difficult being single when you start getting older. Worst comes to worst, tap into the divorcee pool and get yourself a heartbroken hunny looking for a rebound. 

If you have few close friends than it's time to make some more by opening yourself up and actively seeking some. A solid homie is not just going to pop up in your life. Good friends are hard to come by and takes work like any relationship. What are your interests or hobbies? It's easier to make friends when you have a common interest. There's a meetup, convention, local chapter, etc. for everything you can possibly conceive of. If being Asian is a big part of your identity and life, go join an Asian org or asian club sports team at your local community center. There's leagues for every age range, so you can find others similar to yourself. Once you graduate college, it's difficult for most to make new meaningful friendship. You're going to have to put in the effort. Finding that bromance is no different than find a great woman. 

Ultimately, you don't have to be different to belong. You just have to find your place. For some it comes easy and natural, for others we have to work for it. The moment you adopt a defeatist attitude is the day you pretty much accepted that life is unfair and hard but it's not within your control to dictate. We both know that's not true. Yes, your cards may be stacked against you. Yes, being Asian is like playing hardcore mode in America, but it's not impossible. All you have to do is get more skilled at playing the game of life. 

Ask yourself what you really want out of life. Make a list of short term/long term goals, things you want do, see, accomplish however big or small. Having a direction in life and something to work towards is very important because it gives our lives meaning. 

And all it really takes is one person to really change our lives around. Whether it is yourself after finding that self-empowerment or through another, don't lose hope until the very end. We become discontent with our lives when our lives become stagnant. Progress is important. Keep working on yourself, read and watch a shitload of self-help books and videos. Start caring less about what other people think. Put yourself out there. Open yourself up to the world. Take risks. And after all this if you still feel the same than at least you have the satisfaction knowing that you didn't leave one rock left unturned and you lived your life to the fullest.

I recommend this book to you. It can help you on adopting a new outlook on life and replacing it with your current toxic views: https://www.amazon.com/Heart-Buddhas-Teaching-Transforming-Liberation/dp/0767903692/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482592780&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=buddhism

You deserve to be happy. You have to let yourself. Happiness is a state of mind. It truly is. Buddhist monks in Bhutan are considered the happiest in the world, yet they have none of the things you speak of. It's like if you took an exam for class that was hard af, and you just found out you aced it. Immediately, your whole day starts looking brighter and everything starts going your way. The exam itself did not give you the feeling of happiness or your newfound positive outlook on life, it's just a meaningless piece of paper.. you did. You created that sensation, that release of hormones, by perceiving things in a more positive lens. You have to become aware that your perception and reality is not actually reality. It is a sum of your own bias life experiences and exposures. Keep fighting for the life you want. We're all rooting for you brotha!",39,,oldmajar,,,2016,12,2016-12-24T15:30:48,t5_30c2m,0,AsianMasculinity,http://reddit.com/r/AsianMasculinity/comments/5k1n6u/c/dbkz419,bb064a0d6031d46d3cd71bf9233080a55f5edefe6d67758550eb4208a96d60ca

I have a very old [Wahl Color Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Wahl-Color-Complete-Cutting-79300-400T/dp/B000JNQSIQ/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1480860211&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=electric+clipper)  and a newer Conair clipper for cutting my son's hair.  His hair is very thick and the Conair just chokes on it.  I'd spend some time looking for a good quality clipper in your price range.

First clip your hair down with the clippers as tight as you can go.  I know a few guys that do this about once a week or every two weeks so all they have is stubble.  They don't use a blade like I do.

Then use a razor of your choice.  If you're intending on using a multi-blade (like a Mach 3) you'll probably find that it gets clogged with a lot of hair gunk pretty quickly and can be difficult to get the hair out of the blades if your hair was too long when you started shaving.  It is for this reason that I use a safety razor as you can simply spin the head and rinse it out in a matter of seconds.  It takes me no more than 3 minutes to completely shave my head.

Read [Superman: Lois and Clark](https://www.amazon.com/Superman-Lois-Clark-Dan-Jurgens/dp/140126249X/), then Superman Rebirth #1, and then the current Superman ongoing series - it's currently on its 12th issue plus an annual. Superman also stars in Action Comics (which since Rebirth has gone back to its original numbering, starting with Action Comics 957), but I don't find that series as interesting as the Superman series.",24,,internetosaurus,,,2016,12,2016-12-17T19:13:52,t5_33g1z,0,supergirlTV,http://reddit.com/r/supergirlTV/comments/5ivohr/c/dbbczof,5c455ef36e8ead7c093fb9a82a9b69ada3eb953e5d712acb3fa71c420db7f6b4

**Tip #1**

Get this [wire pulling gel, it's a large bottle](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Klein-Tools-32-oz-Premium-Synthetic-Clear-Lubricant-51028/100660159), so i break it down into some [small-medium squeezable condiment bottles](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lwnCT-VAL._SL1500_.jpg), and i just take 1 with me to the range in my range bag. Just make sure to get some with screw-on caps, you don't want to have one leak in a range bag haha.

**Tip 2:**

Eventually you'll need to replace the o-ring inside the Indexing Ring/Spring Retainer (for the booster), don't get the Booster O-Ring Pack (2 pieces) from SiCo for $9. Get a bag of 100 [from Amazon Prime for $12.29](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MN9T9I/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1), bag of 50 is $13.57, so just get the 100 pack.

Specs for the booster o-ring are: **018** Viton O-Ring, 75A Durometer, Black, 3/4"" ID, 7/8"" OD, 1/16"" Width (Pack of 100). The size is the bolded number, size 018. You'll see in the reviews with other suppressors owners buying the same thing and saying they'll fit Octanes, Osprey's, and Omega 9K's booster o-ring. 

**Tip #3**

Get a case of [Speer Lawman 147gr 9mm from SGAmmo](http://sgammo.com/product/speer/1000-round-case-9mm-luger-speer-lawman-147-grain-tmj-subsonic-ammo-53620). Awesome sub ammo.

**Tip #4**

I don't know if you have something similar already, but i use [a GoRuck Echo Field Pocket](http://imgur.com/a/3Xaep) to hold suppressor parts/tools.

First clip your hair down with the clippers as tight as you can go.  I know a few guys that do this about once a week or every two weeks so all they have is stubble.  They don't use a blade like I do.

Then use a razor of your choice.  If you're intending on using a multi-blade (like a Mach 3) you'll probably find that it gets clogged with a lot of hair gunk pretty quickly and can be difficult to get the hair out of the blades if your hair was too long when you started shaving.  It is for this reason that I use a safety razor as you can simply spin the head and rinse it out in a matter of seconds.  It takes me no more than 3 minutes to completely shave my head.

They hate being cold. If you live in a climate where it gets pretty cold in the winter it might be easier to litter box or potty pad train him. No matter what, don't get discouraged about potty training, this is the number one reason IG's end up in shelters.

They make great companions and want nothing more than to cuddle up with you under the blankets. They are very loyal to their owners and can be skittish around strangers. The more you can socialize him the better. They are very smart and highly trainable, it might take a little extra persistence but don't give up.

If you have any specific questions I'd be happy the answer them. [My IG](http://imgur.com/a/hBauz) is 8 now and I wouldn't trade her for anything.

Probably has to do with the fact USB-C is usually synonymous with USB 3.1 Gen 2, so needs to be able to do 10Gbps, so PCI-E lanes need to be there in place and low end CPUs tend not to have a lot of lanes, so need PLX-like switches (which add cost) and/or the PCH (Southbridge) has to make up for it but again, low end usually doesn't.  I'm speculating though.  Higher end CPUs and mobos tend to be able to do this but probably like someone else mentioned demand is low still and new for current stuff out there. But CES is in January and AMD Zen and other Intel products are coming out, so new motherboards will be shown, so maybe it'll change.

One is you need to stay in regular practice reading music, which is not necessarily the same as ""sight reading."" Experts say you're supposed to sight read to better your sight reading skills, but most music students (brass and woodwind players, pianists, percussionists) have been steeped in *daily* reading practice on their instruments for literally years before they get to college. Only rarely are they sight reading; most of what they read are pieces they're preparing for performance, so they're having the basics reinforced on a constant basis, and if they're in band, orchestra, or choir they have not only a director/conductor correcting them, but peers to help reinforce their learning.  

For the most part guitarists don't encounter these situations until much later in their journeys, and by then *everyone* is a much better reader than they are, so it's pretty intimidating.

So, one solution is to get a fakebook and begin reading melodies every day, and not just sight read them, but *learn* them, and then reread them on the regular. This runs counter to what the experts say, but see above. You've got to have that regular grounding to get to the fluent sight reading stage. 

Etudes are another way to reinforce this. Again, you're actually learning these to performance level, and not just ""sight reading practice."" An excellent book for this is Sam Most's [*Jazz Improvisation*](www.powells.com/book/jazz-improvisation-9781576236543/65-146), which is 217 one chorus etudes on the changes to different standard tunes. 

Another book which has helped me a lot and I've used with reading practice in college guitar classes is Wm. Leavitt's [*Melodic Rhythms for Guitar*](https://www.amazon.com/Melodic-Rhythms-Guitar-William-Leavitt/dp/0634013327/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1480782681&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=melodic+rhythms+for+guitar). The premise here is learning all of the common rhythmic combinations of basic note values - whole notes, half, quarter, eighths, and triplets - there are both isolated studies of each rhythm and etudes that make use of them. 

Last, see if you can get together with other players and read through tunes or whatever. If you're in a large enough pool of guitar players to find a reading group it's a great way to share your pain and progress.

**How do you make yourself an adequate teacher?**

This is the wrong question. You shouldn't strive to be adequate, but to be *fluent* in your subject. Once you understand English, the grammar, syntax, pronunciation, its workings and intricacies, you shouldn't need to worry about ""adequacy."" If you enjoy your subject, fluency in it will be reflected in how you teach it. I hope I won't be considered presumptuous when I say that a lot of teachers of English have very little actual knowledge of the language beyond speaking it. If this reads like you, do yourself a favor and learn English more intimately. There is a lot to know, and only being able to *speak* it, even with some educational methods behind you, is going to be detrimental to your teaching.

&gt; Today was the first day of teaching in my entire life and it was a thrill to be in front of a classroom attempting to command the student's attention. 

It may just be my interpretation of your wording, but try not to *command* their attention. Work *with* your students and *lead* them into the lesson. 

It's difficult to give you ""tips and tricks"" without knowing the students' ages. However, I'll try to give you some of my philosophy:

Educator Thomas Carruthers once said, ""A teacher is one who makes himself progressively unnecessary."" The goal in your classroom should be not to simply educate, but to guide. Encourage your students to think and explore a subject. Since I don't know what exactly you're teaching, I'll use prepositions as an example. Here is how I teach them:

1. Identify the important words for the lesson: In, On, Between, Above, Below, Under, Next to, Behind

2. Demonstrate the words in a manner that coaxes and demonstrates, but doesn't just deliver and give, the meaning. With the above words, I initially use a chair and have a student come sit on the chair. I ask the class where that student is and they usually reply, ""On the chair!"" I maneuver the student around the chair and try to get everyone to use prepositions in regards to the chair/student combo. Progressively, I use less and less wording in my questions until they are just saying locations without being prompted.

3. I give my students a paper with various objects and lines on it (for example, Stage / ______; _______ / Podium / Window...etc.). They do a hunt around and outside of the classroom to determine where these objects (labeled, as not all are known) are in relation to *other* objects. They are actively engaged, using English, discovering new objects *and* reinforcing their understanding of the words.

4. Bring students back and discuss their findings.

5. Introduce the dialog that uses the aforementioned prepositions. They now have more confidence in the text's information.

This is just one example lesson, though the main point is always to actively engage students. A lot of teachers end up just talking at students, which often leaves everyone confused. You may or may not have done this, but it's something to keep in mind.

Unfortunately, there is no surefire way to eliminate boredom from language acquisition, but active engagement is a method that can be used for its reduction.

**How do you make yourself appealing to the students?**

I am just myself. I bring my humanity into the classroom and don't divide the class into teacher/student. Instead, I view the whole as a community. My students know about and inquire as to my hobbies, and I show genuine interest in their lives. You may be surprised at how effective this can be.

**How long does it take you to feel stable and confident with the job?**

I feel it is difficult to feel *stable* in a cram school. That's the nature of that beast: parents and admins will always be on you about something.

**How do you make yourself an adequate teacher?**

This is the wrong question. You shouldn't strive to be adequate, but to be *fluent* in your subject. Once you understand English, the grammar, syntax, pronunciation, its workings and intricacies, you shouldn't need to worry about ""adequacy."" If you enjoy your subject, fluency in it will be reflected in how you teach it. I hope I won't be considered presumptuous when I say that a lot of teachers of English have very little actual knowledge of the language beyond speaking it. If this reads like you, do yourself a favor and learn English more intimately. There is a lot to know, and only being able to *speak* it, even with some educational methods behind you, is going to be detrimental to your teaching.

&gt; Today was the first day of teaching in my entire life and it was a thrill to be in front of a classroom attempting to command the student's attention. 

It may just be my interpretation of your wording, but try not to *command* their attention. Work *with* your students and *lead* them into the lesson. 

It's difficult to give you ""tips and tricks"" without knowing the students' ages. However, I'll try to give you some of my philosophy:

Educator Thomas Carruthers once said, ""A teacher is one who makes himself progressively unnecessary."" The goal in your classroom should be not to simply educate, but to guide. Encourage your students to think and explore a subject. Since I don't know what exactly you're teaching, I'll use prepositions as an example. Here is how I teach them:

1. Identify the important words for the lesson: In, On, Between, Above, Below, Under, Next to, Behind

2. Demonstrate the words in a manner that coaxes and demonstrates, but doesn't just deliver and give, the meaning. With the above words, I initially use a chair and have a student come sit on the chair. I ask the class where that student is and they usually reply, ""On the chair!"" I maneuver the student around the chair and try to get everyone to use prepositions in regards to the chair/student combo. Progressively, I use less and less wording in my questions until they are just saying locations without being prompted.

3. I give my students a paper with various objects and lines on it (for example, Stage / ______; _______ / Podium / Window...etc.). They do a hunt around and outside of the classroom to determine where these objects (labeled, as not all are known) are in relation to *other* objects. They are actively engaged, using English, discovering new objects *and* reinforcing their understanding of the words.

4. Bring students back and discuss their findings.

5. Introduce the dialog that uses the aforementioned prepositions. They now have more confidence in the text's information.

This is just one example lesson, though the main point is always to actively engage students. A lot of teachers end up just talking at students, which often leaves everyone confused. You may or may not have done this, but it's something to keep in mind.

Unfortunately, there is no surefire way to eliminate boredom from language acquisition, but active engagement is a method that can be used for its reduction.

**How do you make yourself appealing to the students?**

I am just myself. I bring my humanity into the classroom and don't divide the class into teacher/student. Instead, I view the whole as a community. My students know about and inquire as to my hobbies, and I show genuine interest in their lives. You may be surprised at how effective this can be.

**How long does it take you to feel stable and confident with the job?**

I feel it is difficult to feel *stable* in a cram school. That's the nature of that beast: parents and admins will always be on you about something. To actually answer you question, though, it depends on the person. I know people who have been here for decades that still don't feel stable in their schools. There are teachers I met only last year that  have exceeded expectations and become such fixtures in their schools that it is like they've always been there and will remain necessary.

So.

1) Replace your exfoliant with CeraVe Hydrating facial cleanser. It's not going to feel like your face is clean for the first like week to two weeks because you're probably used to the very squeaky clean (stripped) feeling. But focus on how your skin feels about two minutes after you pat it dry - that clean-but-not-desert feeling is delightful. 

2) Add a purely hydrating layer. Depending on what type of environment you're in, that might be [Hada Labo lotion](https://smile.amazon.com/Hada-Labo-Gokujyn-Hyaluronic-Lotion/dp/B000FQUGXA/ref=sr_1_2_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482904403&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=hada+labo) or a serum. If you're in a dryer area, you probably want a glycerine-based serum or lotion rather than a hyaluronic acid based one, as HA can actually draw water from your skin if there isn't enough in the air. 

3) Consider a thicker night cream like CeraVe in the tub, Jason Gentle Basics night cream, or (again depending on your area) a thin layer of petroleum jelly (Vaseline) to help your skin keep the moisture in it. If you're in central California or the south  - somewhere with humid air - putting your hydrating layer on, sitting for a minute or two, then finishing with Vaseline might be enough. If you're in Tucson, you're probably going to want something like the CeraVe in the tub or the Jason to add additional layers of hydration to your skin. 

4) As /u/glittercrotch said, r/asianbeauty is a great resource. There are lots of skincare companies in various Asian countries that have affordable, high quality products that you can get on Amazon. The Hada Labo lotion is one, and you might check out something like the Hada Labo Skin Plumping Gel-Cream for your thicker cream step.

I bought a bag of Wizdice years ago when everyone was praising them for the number of complete sets.  My son and I eagerly put together the bag and got ONE complete set.  3 days later Wizdice reached out to me via reddit because of a post I made and offered to send me a new bag, because the bag I got was a ""bag of hurt.""

I didn't even complain in the post.  I just said that not every bag is a winner and that's the chance you take,  I'm still happy with the purchase.

So, now I always recommend Wizdice to everyone, because they went above and beyond for me.

[Oiselle's Rundies $70](http://www.oiselle.com/shop/gifts-for-runners/rundies) - Totally cute, fun, underwear for runners. Oiselle is a company that focuses solely on women's products. Their products are high-quality and functional.

If your girlfriend does races and has race medals, one of these is a great way to keep them organized and displayed. There are many different designs with different quotes and whatnot, so take your pick, this is just my favorite.

[Buff headwear $20-30](http://www.buffwear.com/) - I don't actually have one of these yet, but it's on my wishlist for this year. A multi-functional piece of fabric good for hot or cold weather. Choose from dozens of different colors and designs. Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSvRm4CHmvE) to see all the different ways it can be worn.

[Feetures! Compression socks $15-$50](https://feeturesrunning.com/) - Talk about a gift that a runner really wants - compression socks are the shit. Especially if she's running in some sorry ass cotton socks right now, she might ask you to marry her if you buy her some Feetures.

What I mean by that (and what I assume the reviewer meant) is that by using a rule based on the z-score, you will remove data points that were generated by the same process as the ""valid"" data points. An example: Let's say your data is normally distributed with no ""real"" outliers. We would expect about 4.6% of all data points to have an absolute z-score &gt; 2. This means that even if no outliers are present at all, your rule (abs(z) &gt; 2) discardes 4.6% of perfectly valid data. This doesn't mean that such rules are a-priori invalid. But they are more often than not viewed as too dogmatic.

Hawkins (1980) defines an outlier as:

&gt; An outlier is an obersvation which deviates so much from the other observations as to arouse suspicions that it was generated by a different mechanism.

Ideally, you should only exclude data points once you understand *why* it doesn't belong to the rest of the data. Possibilities include: measurement error, data entry error etc.

Aggarwal (2013) discusses the exact method your PI told you to do on pages 7-8.

An example: Let's say your data is normally distributed with no ""real"" outliers. We would expect about 4.6% of all data points to have an absolute z-score &gt; 2. This means that even if no outliers are present at all, your rule (abs(z) &gt; 2) discardes 4.6% of perfectly valid data. This doesn't mean that such rules are a-priori invalid. But they are more often than not viewed as too dogmatic.

Hawkins (1980) defines an outlier as:

&gt; An outlier is an obersvation which deviates so much from the other observations as to arouse suspicions that it was generated by a different mechanism.

Ideally, you should only exclude data points once you understand *why* it doesn't belong to the rest of the data. Possibilities include: measurement error, data entry error etc.

Aggarwal (2013) discusses the exact method your PI told you to do on pages 7-8.

This is a genuine antique Japanese sword. Specifically, it's a [hira-zukuri](#t ""flat cross section"") [wakizashi](#t ""short sword""). Please read my [owner's guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/swords/wiki/owningnihonto) for details on care, photography, appraisal and restoration. In particular, we will need more (and specific) photos of the blade. Mounts and blades are related but separate topics.

The fittings are typical middling-level Edo period (1603-1868) work; the [fuchi](#t ""reinforcing metal collar on the hilt"") and [kashira](#t ""metal cap on the end of the hilt"") done in [shakudo](#t ""a black alloy of copper and gold"") [nanako](#t ""lit. fish roe, many small dots hand-punched"") have suffered some white/green corrosion suggesting this piece has been stored in a wet environment (garage?). The [menuki](#t ""palm ornaments"") are interesting, a gold basket and something else in shakudo? I can't quite see (also you've shown them upside-down). Again a bit of corrosion in the shakudo. The [tsuba](#t ""hand guard"") looks to be an iron example — as is common — with a pictorial scene; I am not an expert in iron tsuba, so you may want to post in the tosogu forum of the Nihonto Message Board for an assessment of which school/tradition this piece would fall into. Finally, the [habaki](#t ""metal reinforcing wedge that marries the blade to the scabbard"") looks to be two-piece silver, usually these are silver jacket over copper but we can't see based on these photos. [Saya](#t ""scabbard"") is a typical black lacquered piece, totally standard.

As to the blade: please read the guide I linked above and get us the photos listed therein, *especially of the tang*. The patina on the tang, file marks, shape, peg holes, everything tells a story — and with any luck, there'll be a signature we can cross-reference against records. Oh, and **please carefully wipe down the blade with a [microfiber cloth](https://www.amazon.com/Pack-MagicFiber-Microfiber-Cleaning-Cloths/dp/B0050R67U0/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482012044&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=microfiber+cloth), e.g. camera cloth** to clean off any smudges and the like so we get the best results from the pics. But **don't do anything to harm the existing polish!** Simply wiping with a dry microfiber cloth is sufficient.

However, even without that, I can tell you a couple things. Unless I'm mistaking smudges or oil or something for hamon, the thing that immediately stands out is the wandering, randomized, patchy splashes of [hamon](#t ""martensitic white edge steel from differential quenching"") in the pattern known as *hitatsura*. That pattern is classically associated with the Soshu (Sagami province) school of classical smithing, one of the five major categorizations of Japanese smithing traditions. Also, a broad (profile) but thin (cross-section) hira-zukuri wakizashi is typical of this school. They tended to do a higher-temperature heat treatment resulting in the formation of *nie*, coarse visible martensitic particles which form various aggregate structures and effects in the steel. Done well, it's very prized and beautiful; done poorly, it's seen as a bit uncontrolled. The difference is subtle and I wouldn't venture a final guess on quality from just these photos, but it looks decent if not exactly masterful.

My gut feeling right now is that we are looking at a sue-Soshu (late Soshu) piece, 1500s or later, by [one of the Tsunahiro 綱廣 line](http://www.nihonto.com/abtarttsunahiro.html). They are decent swords but most of the later generations are not masterpieces or exceptionally valuable. You can see some representative examples, some in hitatsura, [here](http://www.nihontoantiques.com/archive/g77.htm) / [here](http://www.aoijapan.com/wakizashi-soshu-jyu-tsunahiro-shodai) / [here](http://www.nihonto.com.au/html/soshu_tsunahiro_wakizashi.html) and [here](http://www.nihontocraft.com/Soshu_Tsunahiro_Wakizashi.htm). This is a significant guess on my part, I practice *kantei* (a ""blind"" appraisal game) but am not exactly a master at it. I'm more thinking out loud than making an actual appraisal right now.

Took my first math class at the ripe age of 30 in college; could barely do simple multiplication/division so I started from the ground up by taking the most remedial course.

3 math classes later (all A+) I'm now in pre-calculus, tutoring other students, and planning to teach math at a high school or college level. Khan Academy and Pre-Algebra for Dummies by Mark Zegarelli were huge helps for getting me up to speed (which is good, because 2 out of 3 of my teachers weren't very good at teaching).    

I grew up with the idea that I was ""bad at math"" and I internalized this idea as a ""truth"". I had internalized the idea to such an extent that it influenced my entire educational and professional career; I actively avoided any STEM degrees and went into law instead. I threw away my potential because of the lie/self-degradation that some people are simply ""bad"" at math. I wasn't bad at math; I just didn't have the tools I needed to succeed.  

Today I have my choice of teachers, teacher review sites, video tutorials like Khan Academy, alternative text books, and text book reviews. I didn't have those tools as a high school student. High school math was an exercise in humiliation and debasement. I want to be a math teacher because I NEVER want another student to feel the way that I felt.



EDIT 1: Thanks for the gold stranger!

EDIT 2: Here's the book I used to prepare me for my first math class. It's a newer edition than the one I used:

I bought mine when it was $200+ but I guess prices have dropped now.


**What I love about it:** 

- It's wider format (I've done 1 2x18"" paper easily as well as 4""x6"" backto back)

- The ink is easy to replace - I buy [non OEM inks for cheap on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00D921JPQ/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_1zOxybFE33W8H) and they last a loooong time (I printed about 1000 greeting cards without needing to change cartridge at one point)

- Maintenance has been incredibly easy

- I've used 120# cover in it as well as inkjet photo paper, stickers, and regular 20# printer paper - feeds it well

- the quality is GREAT, I've had almost little to no streaking, and if there is usually it's low on ink or the printer head just needs to be realigned which is easy to do on the printer settings.

Cannot recommend highly enough. I run a greeting card business out of my home office and I am literally about to get a second one.

32 Pigeons (doves) have received the Dickin metal for their service in war (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_pigeon). 

Doves seem dumb to us, yet their navigational abilities are simply unimaginable to our intellect. Doves can routinely be trapped in a dark box, transported hundreds of miles, released and then fly straight back to where they started at a pace faster than a car driving on roads (about 40-60mph in a straight line, no stoplights). With all our science and computers we still don't even know exactly how this is possible.  And this is the same exact species of street pigeons/sky rat/etc.  you see in every city (Rock Dove).

1) Read this article on the [five stages of recovery](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-five-stages-of-recovery.html) about *her*, seeing where she is among those five stages.

2) Read this article on the [patterns &amp; characteristics](http://coda.org/index.cfm/newcomers/patterns-and-characteristics-of-codependence/) of codependency about you *and* her.

3) Read about the [Karpman Drama Triangle](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=karpman%20drama%20triangle) about you and her, and her and her other, original family members.

4) Learn about [family secrets](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=family+secrets+psychology) and the [emotional blackmail](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=emotional+blackmail) used to protect them, because it is typical in the childhood families of adult survivors. 

5) Read about [reactive attachment disorder](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=reactive+attachment+disorder), because it is usually what the child acquires when abused by those she must depend upon to survive. 

6) Look for [CoDA meetings](http://locator.coda.org/) in your area and go to six before making a decision to continue or not... because it is likely that you will need to know about [psychological boundaries](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=psychological+boundaries) and how to raise and lower them appropriately as your wife struggles with -- and seems to flip back and forth from -- fear of abuse here and fear of abandonment there.  

7) Look over [these books](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=books%20adult%20survivors%20of%20child%20abuse), pick one or two, and read it about you *and* her.

8) Look over [this link to this book](https://www.amazon.com/Borderline-Personality-Disorder-Survival-Guide/dp/1572245077/ref=sr_1_fkmr3_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479758295&amp;sr=1-1-fkmr3&amp;keywords=Alexander+Chapman+Kim+Gratz+Borderline), get the book, and work through it for your own sake, regardless of what she does or doesn't do. 

9) Come to understand that she may have [BPD](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=borderline+personality+disorder) as a coping system for the [C-PTSD](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=c-ptsd) that is typical among adult survivors. BPD is a set of dysfunctional -- but understandable -- coping mechanisms for untreated child abuse and resulting C-PTSD. The best psychotherapies for it are those that understand the causes resulting in and physiological conditions of a shredded [autonomic nervous system](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=autonomic+nervous+system) no longer capable of managing her ""[fight-flight-freeze](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=fight+flight+freeze)"" response to perceived threat.

10) [DBT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=dialectical+behavior+therapy) is the current gold standard for managing the emotions and behaviors that come with BPD &amp; complex PTSD. She can find people in her area who know how to administer it through [Behavioral Tech](http://behavioraltech.org/index.cfm?CFID=53962983&amp;CFTOKEN=86772797), and even adjunct therapy [workbooks like these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=DBT+therapy+workbooks). One can also get a lot of support from [DBT Self-Help](http://www.dbtselfhelp.com/) and organizations like [DBT-NJ](https://groups.psychologytoday.com/rms/prof_results.php?state=NJ&amp;spec=488), so dig around for them online, but advise her not to try to ""get well"" on the cheap.

I often make the decision to drive to work, just because my bus commute is 2.5x the journey time (drive is 25-30 minutes, bus is 70-80 minutes). One of the reasons the bus commute is so long is because my local bus runs once an hour, leaving me with a 20 minute wait for a connection. I have to use it because the P&amp;R fills up before 7am. 

I would happily pay even a largish fee if I had a guaranteed spot at the P&amp;R which would allow me to bus to work in a much more reasonable time (I estimate 35-40min).

&gt; In this no-holds-barred treatise, Shoup argues that free parking has contributed to auto dependence, rapid urban sprawl, extravagant energy use, and a host of other problems. Planners mandate free parking to alleviate congestion but end up distorting transportation choices, debasing urban design, damaging the economy, and degrading the environment. Ubiquitous free parking helps explain why our cities sprawl on a scale fit more for cars than for people, and why American motor vehicles now consume one-eighth of the world's total oil production.",9,,clothesliner,,,2016,12,2016-12-28T20:00:58,t5_2vbli,0,SeattleWA,http://reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/5kqjli/c/dbq7ba3,a19542f3122c820ae0363310e39ec40cf5b12e3720b82c12b915a9eae6392633

It isn't the cheapest around, but is the ""best"". Why? It allows a RS player to leave their guitar in just E-standard or Drop D tuning - or swap between those 2 - and play all but around a dozen of the songs available to a PS user. Dethklok dlc on an e-standard guitar with 008 gauge strings? No problems.  
  
The other thing I'd recommend if he doesn't already have - a really good set of WIRED headphones.

They follow rules from tradition, handed down from Jesus through a continuous succession of popes. They think the Bible is a great book, but not exactly the word of God.

Fundamentalist Christians generally believe that Catholics have drifted from Jesus teachings. Instead, they believe the only true way to follow Jesus is through the Bible. They think that the Bible is the literal word of God and is exactly true.

For those interested in the apparent conflict between science and religion, a great book to read is by Francis Collins, one of the leaders behind the sequencing of the human genome, the current head of the NIH, and a deeply religious man, T*he Language of God: A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief*

But I also don't see the point of having to be loud every time something bad happens. There usually are press releases by orgs such as CAIR, ICNA, ISNA. Or if you go to well known American scholars' Facebook pages such as Omar Suleiman, Yasir Qadhi, they generally have a status regarding attacks. But I don't believe I have to go out of my way to openly condemn it, though I do and if someone asked me I would answer. But my words won't stop people like ISIS from being the shit bags they are and honestly I stopped caring what others think or me or my religion because generally people already have their minds made up. But I'd like to believe that if I was in a situation where an attack was happening, that I'd risk or give my life if it saved someone else's.

In it he examines how American life works compared to what he has experienced in Europe and is amazed at the vibrant civil society in America. To be honest, I have not read it through, but American civil society is something that has been shrinking more and more over time as reliance on the state grows. For example, if you are interested to see how things such as unemployment insurance and aid to the poor worked before the state gave itself a monopoly on it, [From Mutual Aid to the Welfare State: Fraternal Societies and Social Services, 1890-1967](https://www.amazon.com/Mutual-Aid-Welfare-State-Fraternal/dp/0807848417/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1481948326&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=from+mutual+aid+to+welfare) is the definitive work on that.  
  
What all of this implies to me is a direct refutation of the charge laid against libertarians that we are anti-social and just care about ourselves. I think it is the exact opposite. In the absence of the state, we are forced to see the care of our neighbor as our own responsibility, not just some thing that we cast a vote for and feel good about ourselves and call it a day. We are forced to work together to solve problems more frequently instead of the society reliant on the state so much today that people now call the police to tell their neighbors to be quiet. What happens when we rely on government to take care of these things is it becomes much more impersonal. We somehow think that the money taken automatically out of our taxes is all that needs to be done.",6,,paxitas,,,2016,12,2016-12-17T04:22:42,t5_2qh63,0,Libertarian,http://reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/5iojqq/c/dbapfci,1c092a8bb990cc57e0bca2e3fdf3634919931998cac32ce179bd3be31a00eda8

These 4 are the only other pops from The Flash line that are over $10. Captain Cold Unmasked is an Entertainment Earth exclusive, so you can get it through there or off ebay. Gorilla Grodd was a 2016 SDCC exclusive as well, but if you get it now-ish, it should range from $20-40 off ebay. Jay Garrick is a Legion of Collector (Funko's DC subscription box) exclusive.

I suggest taking a step back from the archetype of Mercury the Messenger and take a look at Mercury's nature as a planet. It's fast, it's very changeable due to it's routine retrogrades, it's androgynous rather than masculine or feminine, and takes on different nature according to phase and zodiacal location.

Moving on to the rulership thing, a favorite analogy of mine comes from Austin Coppock, who said Mercury as ruler of Gemini is the journalist, and Mercury as ruler of Virgo is the scholar. Both Gemini and Virgo have the Mercury thing going on where they want to pick things apart and look at every detail, but Gemini wants to think/talk about it and Virgo wants to see, touch, confirm, and do it. Both Gemini and Virgo have this ""figure it out"" quality, but Gemini is more mind oriented and Virgo is more concrete and grounded. Both are ruled by Mercury who is going to take it all apart and put it back together again, it's just that Gemini is going to do it all mentally then talk about it and Virgo is going to literally take the thing apart and line up all the parts and write down what each one does. (I should mention that when I talk about Gemini and Virgo, I'm just using analogies to illustrate the energy I'm talking about, I'm not talking about sun signs)

I would also suggest the documentary Night Will Fall for some info on the reversal of the DeNazification policy.

It a stupid lie to even believe: that somehow the vast majority of Germans were unaware and uninvolved. The scale of the operation makes it impossible on both fronts. Hitler was ENORMOUSLY popular, Anti-Semitism and White Nationalism were the principle policies of the enourmously popular government. They made it illegal for Jews to own businessess or property and revoked their citizenship, then they (and the gypsies and the gays, and the mentally ill and so on) started disappearing left and right... How is that possibly going on without you knowing? How many people had to be involved? It's not even worth arguing. After the war, we realized basically the whole country needed to be prosecuted, it wasn't practical, so we pretended they were innocent. It's very simple.

I'm not an overly peppy person by nature but after about a week I quickly realized that I would have to be far more assertive &amp; serious than usual. I would always try to be standing when introducing myself, make a point of saying what my role was, &amp; I was never the first one to offer to get/make coffee or organize office gatherings etc. Basically I started treating the guys with the exact same attitude of condescension &amp; superiority they gave me (tho never to the point of being unprofessional). That change in attitude seemed to seep through to everything &amp; after a few weeks, the guys at the site realized they had to take me seriously. So that would be my first tip, regardless of clothing.

Clothing-wise it might be worth it to try &amp; stick to your general uniform of jeans/boots/shirts so you still feel like 'you' but start to choose pieces w/ a bit of edge to them. For example, when I read your above description of jeans &amp; riding boots, this: http://i.imgur.com/A06riBV.jpg is what I'm envisioning. If that's close, I can see how it would read as young &amp; more like immature college student than tech professional.

Perhaps try black/dark grey/navy skinny jeans or ponte pants tucked into black leather engineer boots? Or go a step further &amp; get some more office-wear type ankle boots like these [Danskos](https://www.amazon.com/Dansko-Bonita-Womens-Boot/dp/B00IL2N7UE/ref=pd_sim_309_16?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=YZZC582KNETVJTZM83W8). I'm not sure what your t-shirt collection looks like, but w the above pants/boot combo &amp; a basic tank/tee under a cardigan, I think you would look work appropriate, hopefully still feel like you but appear edgier or tougher than you might look now.

A calorie is a measure of energy. What you're asking is akin to saying ""How do I warm up? More Farenheights or more celsiuses?"" 

Now, certain diets are more satiating, so easier to maintain and practically commit to. Fats and proteins are more 'fillings' than simple sugars and carbohydrates. A lot of carb rich foods (breads and pastas) are very high calorie for what amounts to very light and 'forgettable' food. So a lot of no carb or low carb diets are effective, but it's not because a slice of bread makes you fat, it's because cutting out all carbs is relatively easy, and for many people, results in a  significant reduction of their normal calorie intake. But 3500 calories of protein will result in weight gain for most people, and 1800 cals of carbs and nothing else will result in weight loss for many people. 

There are a lot of calculators online to calculate your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE, which is a combination of your BMR [Basal Metabolic Rate - the energy you expend to live] and calories for things like walking / running / etc), and they're pretty good. That said, here's what I suggest. Whatever weight you're at, are you broadly maintaining it? Great, so you're at an equilibrium with your intake and expenditure. Spend a week or two **HONESTLY** using the calorie listings on **everything** you eat and drink to measure your intake. BE. FUCKING. HONEST. Get a [food scale](https://www.amazon.com/Vont-Stainless-Multifunction-Different-Measurement/dp/B01FLM2784/ref=lp_289787_1_2/157-3936391-4465451?s=kitchen&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1481269767&amp;sr=1-2-spons&amp;psc=1) and measure. I don't care if you lie to yourself, the body is the ultimate measure of your honesty. 

After you've got your HONEST records of how much you intake for a few weeks, average that out, then aim to reduce it by a couple hundred calories. For a lot of people, replacing colas with zero cal versions is an easy swap, etc. 

Ultimately though, let's get scientific: Fat is your body's way of storing excess energy. You only reduce fat by intaking fewer calories than your body needs to run [TDEE] so that your body calls upon the stored energy in fat. That's a good thing, that's literally why we have fat. After a while of this, you'll come to a new equilibrium (What some call a weight loss plateau) and you'll need to recalculate and reduce your calories further. 

If it helps, try to view it like this: Don't think ""Holy crap, it's hard to get under 3000 calories,"" try to envision how your body has evolved: We are a hunter/gatherer species, and it's not 'shitty' that running an hour only burns about 600 cals, it's *amazing* that 600 calories can let us run and hunt for 6 miles. 600 calories is a LOT if you're hunting and foraging for it. Could you collect 2000 calories in a day? I sure couldn't. It's only because we live in a world with massive caloric surpluses that 3500 cals doesn't seem insanely high. Good luck. But again, be honest. I don't care if you lie to yourself, your body and results will always speak the truth.

John never quotes the OT explicitly, but he makes many allusions to it. Obviously this is a callback to Daniel and the Beasts (empires) coming up out of the chaotic, turbulent sea of world affairs. I understand the sea representing uncertainty, danger and chaos - which successive powerful beasts supercede through conquering and might to subjugate and bring order, however beastly. So in Revelation 13 I understand the first Beast (pretty critical to realize there are two beasts in the chapter) as anti-God (or antichrist) Government supported by the second beast, anti-God philosophy/ideology/religion. I see John illustrating Satan's plan to oppress and combat the church (Two Witnesses) both in the 1st century and, in various forms, throughout the Church Age. Same general strategy, varying manifestations throughout Church Age history. 

In the first century, this would be the cult of emperor worship as the anti-God philosophy/religion and the Romans as the anti-God Empire. 

It can be argued that we saw these two hand-in-hand beasts repeating with the rise of Islam/Caliphate, the particularly corrupt periods of the Roman Catholic Church (I should emphasize that I feel there were times when the antichrist was manifest through the Catholic Church, but that's not my primary identification), even the British Empire with the philosophy of Divine Right, Facism propping up Nazi Germany, Marxism supporting the Soviet Union, you can use your imagination. Some would push and throw Capitalism pushing the American Empire.. I'll try not to steer the conversation any further in that direction. 

If you object to the theory of many antichrists, do have a look at [how John explained it in his other book] (https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John+2:18&amp;version=ESV) before being too dismissive.

I'm indebted to Michael Wilcox and [his brief, readable commentary](https://www.amazon.com/Message-Revelation-Bible-Speaks-Today/dp/0877842930/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1481873112&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=michael+wilcox+revelation) on Revelation for this understanding.

Have you ever actually tried IWB?

Get [this airsoft replica of an M&amp;P9c] (http://www.evike.com/products/63614/) with [this POS UTG IWB holster] (https://www.amazon.com/UTG-Concealed-Belt-Holster-Black/dp/B0053EQM32/). 

The holster is not going to be representative of how comfortable or secure an IWB setup can be (do NOT ever use this thing with a real gun), but it will demonstrate how, even with a shit holster on a department store belt, you can conceal a double-stack sub-compact (which is noticeably larger than either the LCP or the LCR) with ease. 

&gt;  I feel like if my shirt comes up I could get made

Your shirt generally doesn't come up that high unless you wear T-shirts that are too short for your body type and make a habit of reaching for high shelves. 

&gt; To me it seems like the best way for me to carry is in the back pocket

Your back pocket negates the primary advantage of pocket carry, which is that you can discretely grip your handgun without raising alarm, and also reduces awareness of retention. 

It'll also suck to sit on a gun for 4+ hours. ",7,,NATOMarksman,,,2016,12,2016-12-05T02:34:27,t5_2s4mc,0,CCW,http://reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/5gjatk/c/dasptwf,70ec568b4c097c12596c06f6a8cc5cffaa0de7d3a7855f32b8f4604c2c238284

There's old school G1 that started back in 1984 (which itself is at least two different continuities, the cartoon and the comic book.  Three if you count the UK comics.)  There's the Cybertron series that your Starscream is from which is part of the Unicron trilogy.  And there's the Bay-formers movies.  While the first two have a little in common, the movie franchise has almost nothing in common with the rest of them other than the basic concept for a few characters.

 This post reminded me of him because we had a set of brother/sister twins in one of our classes. They walked in 15 minutes late one morning and as they took their seats Chris yelled, "" I SMELL INCEST"" at the top of his lungs at them, this was his attempt at a funny joke.  I'd like to emphasize this doesn't have anything to do with Robbie/Abby Martin, quite frankly It's a terrible accusation to make and  says more about the accuser than anyone else.

I find myself more and more attracted to him as time goes on. I love walking through life and all of it's changes with him. I love seeing him grow in his faith, his work, his other relationships with family and friends. And now, with our first baby (a boy!) on the way, I am only growing more in love with him by the day! I can't wait to give birth to our new little addition to the family and see him become the great dad I know he will be. 

I guess spark-wise, we make time to ""date"" and spend quality time together. Intimacy is a priority in our marriage. That doesn't always mean it leads to sex, but sex is often a fundamental part of marriage. We try our best to communicate well. We talk often. When we eat dinner together, phones and any other technology is put away so we can focus on each other.

We know each other's love languages. If you haven't read the book, I recommend it!

- Watch *Fire Walk With Me*: Make sure this is the theatrical cut which is about 130 minutes long.  
- Watch [*The Missing Pieces*](https://www.amazon.com/Twin-Peaks-Entire-Mystery-Blu-ray/dp/B00KCTG4PO/ref=sr_1_2/166-3802798-8528038?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482238310&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=twin+peaks+the+missing+pieces): This is a collection of deleted scenes from the film. They are allegedly canon now and add some depth to the universe for sure.  
- Read *The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer* by Jennifer Lynch.  
- Read *The Autobiography of Special Agent Dale Cooper* by Scott Frost.  
- Read the *Access Guide* (it might be hard to find and it's not that important, but it is sort of fun)  
- Read ***The Secret History of Twin Peaks*** by Mark Frost which just came out. This is very important, as I have a feeling the information in this book will be referenced or enhance the upcoming season.  
- If you bought the Blu Ray collection for *The Missing Pieces*, all the discs contain all sorts of extras. Watch them all, including the Log Lady Intros.  
- Start looking into fan creations. There are some great musicians doing Badalamenti's works (Silencio, Xiu Xiu, etc.) or making their own mixes of the music on YouTube. There are also fan books, like the awesome *Reflections: An Oral History of Twin Peaks* by Brad Dukes. There are also fan podcasts, clothing, art, crafts, film reviews, etc. The fandom offers a lot!  
- Consider attending one of the Twin Peaks Fests, the main one being in North Bend, WA this coming July (tickets on sale in February).  
- Get hyped for season three!

It is probably your most powerful option in your price range, and the only thing I can think that would be able to run games like Planet coater (only on light graphics). It has a skylake i5 processor, 4gb of ram and a 1TB HDD. It has AMD R7 M360 Dedicated graphics which should work okay for Planet coaster. It also has a 1080p display, and a okay battery life.

It has new Kaby Lake i3 processor, 4gb of ram and a 1TB HDD. The ram and storage are also upgradable. It's graphics are intel HD 620 which work fine for most low intensity games, including Starcraft and CS:GO (can also play Overwatch with around 45 FPS on low settings). It also has a full 1080p display and a very long battery life.

If he feels safe, he should hand feed her. Also have him talk in a higher pitched voice. Softly. She's 80 pounds of muscle, but to her he's pretty big himself. He might be more intimidating than either of you think. She might have been treated roughly by a man in her previous life. The hike is a great idea. If he feels safe he should sit or lay on the floor to watch TV. He shouldn't stand over her, he should approach from an arc. The link below is a good book. It helps explain how dogs communicate with each other. How they reassure each other. Maybe he can use some of these methods to let her know that he poses no threat. I felt silly, but after I found my fearful boys I'd give them play bows when I got down on the ground with them. Let her approach him? So it's on her terms. If he's still feeling unsure I'd recommend a behaviorist who can help read her and give you a plan for how to work through this. I found with my boys that I was asking too much from them too quickly. They needed things to be slower. Good luck.

That is, it's basically a collection of features on a flat plane, with no sense of the head as being a solid thing with it's own shape and mass. 

Without getting too much into the specifics of this particular drawing, a couple of things to think about: 

* A good, solid understanding of the skull is *really* helpful when it comes to drawing heads and faces. Drawing skulls alone is a way to take a step back and draw the head without having to worry about capturing a likeness of the person you're drawing, and helps you understand the big, solid masses and forms of the head. That understanding carries over when you ARE ready to try and capture a likeness, because you'll be better able to give your head some real shape and volume. Working from pictures of skulls is a good start, but an [inexpensive skull model like this](https://www.amazon.com/Anatomical-Chart-Company-cs20-Life-Size/dp/B000VKSDYE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482501733&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=artist+skull) is even better, because you can turn it at any angle you want, light it however you want, etc. If you're ever stuck for something to draw or feeling otherwise uninspired, you can always draw your skull from a new angle. 

* Taking a bigger step back, there are some good videos over on /r/artlessons that I think are super helpful for people starting out. Scroll down to one of the first ones , 'how to draw anything', and give it a watch. It's a good, solid starting lesson on how to draw what you see rather than what you think you see.

The left has always been violent and historically fascist. I know a lot of dictionaries have 'fascist' as being a 'right-wing' principle. 
  
  
I think the definition of it should probably be researched by an academic, historian, or political scientist and not determined by what Meriem *perceives* it to be.  I previously thought that also and would assume it is right-wing because we assume any system that wants to confine us is done by the right.  Again, one would assume the definition is what the one you referenced is until you look at one of the primary fathers of fascism, Mussolini.  He was a leftist, by the book.

It's updated constantly although there's a few manufacturers he still plans on adding. Acebeam is the latest he's added and /u/Parametrek is constantly added new models from the existing manufacturers he has on there. Obviously it's a little hard to keep up since it's not like he get reminders when something is released. 

&gt;what is the best ""bang for my buck"" on 18650s from Amazon? Or is there a better vendor that can do the 2 day shipping?

Probably these [Orbtronic 3400mAh](https://www.amazon.com/ORBTRONIC-PROTECTED-Rechargeable-Performance-Batteries/dp/B00CAD6AUE/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482263372&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=3400+18650).

Get this: it is very affordable, it is very easy to maintain the temps using the methods they say (5 degree cooling for each 2 liter of ice). It folds up so when you are not fermenting it can be out of site, it doesn't take a lot of extra space. It really has helped my brewing improve. One other thing is, its a safety measure agianst ruining anything in the apartment because of a blow off. Unless the blow off happens to happen when you open the bag anything would be contained inside the bag. The bag is water tight as stated and I have tested that out.

If you don't have a hospital pump and the correct sized flange they make all the difference according to my wife. We rented a Medela Symphony for $50/month and she never uses the way more convenient to lug around pump in style insurance provided us.

To transition try supplementing. Do around half the feeding however you like (boob or pumped) and then switch to the formula. You might find a really happy medium. Plus you can pump while baby eats with dad.

I got nothing on mom guilt other than to say my wife had it at the beginning but seeing the baby grow and be healthy helped with it.

Instead read some books that inspire or entertain you. You won't have time or energy to read what you want once school starts. Here's some options:

I suspect the truth is pretty mundane, but it'd be neat to see what projects they work on there. Maybe, just maybe, there's a group of giant space cockroaches there that shoot the shit around the coffee station.

https://www.amazon.com/Area-51-Uncensored-Americas-Military/dp/0316202304

That book is a pretty good read about Area 51. Essentially an Air Force (military) and CIA (civilian) aeronautics research facility. Doing research and operations that are extremely sensitive. Also reverse engineering and studying foreign aircraft like MiG and Chinese warplanes. Specifically the U2, F117, A12/SR71, and drone reconnaissance aircraft (before anyone even knew what a drone was) development.

I have the same IKEA throw pillows.

Suggestions:

- Add a piece of art above your bed frame.
- Add an area rug somewhere (you have a lot of room!)

Also, I know you have those huge awesome slanted windows and get a ton of light, but at night your place seems rather dark.  The track lighting and the lamps you have don't provide that *warmth*.

Get another floor lamp and maybe a small table lamp to place near the entertainment center (on the floor).  Also, your space is perfect for string lighting. I'm a big evangelist for [these](https://www.amazon.com/Globe-String-Lights-Bulbs-25ft/dp/B00TZRKE3M/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1481122891&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=string+lights+outdoor).

With lighting, you don't want it to be blasting over your head.  You want to try to **diffuse** the lighting throughout the space.  that will create warmth and a good glow (especially with those wood floors!).

Final note: Please **do not** light this space up with red/blue LED lights blasting everywhere.  Tacky af.  LEDs are good and fine when used properly.

I'm going to shill without compensation for the Instant Pot IP-DUO which is a popular countertop multi-function cooker (pressure cooking, slow cooking, hot plate saute mode, yogurt making) you see recommended on a lot of food blogs for good reason. It's convenient because you just punch in the cooking time and let it do its pressure thing without monitoring a burner. You can cook most any dried bean variety in an hour (tastes better than canned and cheaper), long-cooking grains like barley and wild rice take about half the usual amount of time, and whole white and sweet potatoes steam up in 10 minutes. I use mine all the time to cook rice, dried beans, and one-pot dinners. Think chickpea curry, fast rice pilafs and lentils, wheat berries, risotto without all the stirring, and homemade hummus.

1) What you say about feeling anger is really concerning. I'd be on the lookout for feelings that aren't yours. It doesn't necessarily mean that the ghost is trying to possess you, but as a precaution I wouldn't get drunk or high at your house for awhile since that can leave you in a vulnerable state. If you generally feel like you feel the emotions of others you may have a psychic sensitivity and I recommend wearing a small mirror facing outward, either on a pendant or in your pocket. You can also do 'clearing' exercises, where you ask the universe/God/whatever name you give a general force of goodness, to clear your body, clear your mind, clear your soul, and clear your aura. Think of it as a meditative and calming ritual. You can do it whenever and as often as you like. You can also ask the universe to fill yourself and your house with protective white light.

2) Spirits can get energy from water, which is why taps turning on like yours is one sign of a haunting. Tying your faucet down at night might help.

3) /u/RicottaPuffs recommended spraying sea salt in your corners. I think this is a good idea. I've put bowls of salt in the corners of my rooms during hauntings and it's helped tremendously.

4) So this comes from having read Echo Bodine's book [""The Little Book of True Ghost Stories""](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-True-Ghost-Stories/dp/1571746501/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482623982&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=echo+bodine+ghost+stories) about her time as a ghost hunter in Minnesota. She recommends telling the ghost to leave and go to the light, and (I know this sounds bizarre) asking ""The Squadron"" for help, as they are a group of spirits who used to be ghosts and are willing to help other ghosts let go of their earthly attachments. My feeling is, why not? There's no harm in asking for help from them, and/or from God, and/or from the universe, your spirit guardians, whatever is out there. It will help you. I mean, you've got a ghost, shit's already weird.

5) More on Echo Bodine, the book I linked above has a chapter on getting rid of a ghost. I can't find my copy at the moment to copy down the essential points, but did [find a Q&amp;A she did](http://www.ghoststudy.com/echo.html) where people asked some questions about hauntings.

6) I don't blame you for being scared and stressed.

Here are two that I've used:

[A19 bulb shape but with nub on top as if hand blown glass](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015ZY03VG/)

[ST21 ""classic Edison"" shape](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015CNAZOK/)

These were purchased and installed in January and have been looking great since. The 2200k color of the light and the brightness are right for early-electric-era type fixtures.

2: In my own moves and in helping others decorate I've encountered scores of multi-bulb chandeliers that were lamped with multiple 60W (or 60W equivalent) bulbs. My step one has *always* been to relamp the fixtures with lower-wattage bulbs chosen so that the total lumens produced in sum was the light level that was right for the function of the room. Just because the bulb-sockets say 60W max does not mean that 60W bulbs are appropriate for your installation!

In my view there is no point installing a beautiful chandelier and then lamping it so brightly that no-one can see the thing unless wearing welding-goggles. And if you are starting out with vintage-style bulbs that are already at the extreme ""warm"" end of the spectrum, you might not want level of color-shift that you would get at half or quarter brightness.",8,,drtonmeister,,,2016,12,2016-12-06T17:51:28,t5_2ql97,0,HomeImprovement,http://reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/5gtif6/c/dav2tur,83de684a0a87a8a0504e9a7051eaf1907500095cd2a98c5a53069dd9fe8488af

I'll leave you with the following advice: one cannot pick his club. You may want to follow Chelsea now and think it's for you, but it's not for everyone and forcing support for a club doesn't work.

I suggest you continue to watch football and find out what more you like about it, and whenever that moment happens that makes a club yours, you will know it - and that could be any club, including us, and I hope you find that, no matter what club you end up on.",7,,DasSnaus,,,2016,12,2016-12-19T15:18:07,t5_2rsl6,0,chelseafc,http://reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/5j48yp/c/dbdrr6k,85a128872345a3b578b5ec36cd28011077d03773e2b575ffc8e3a765e19e7491

Jensen and J. Philippe Rushton, have been heavily criticized in the past for their overtly racist publications. 

Now this doesn't mean the study you posted is necessarily wrong, but keep in mind Jensen's work is almost entirely funded by the Pioneer Fund, which the SPLC labels as a ""[hate group](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2015/active-white-nationalist-groups)"", and which which many *many* prominent researchers label as ""[an organization solely designed to fund racism](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/49445)."" Furthermore, upon examining the references in this study, I can see that Jensen received [1.1 million](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2962466?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) dollars from the Pioneer Fund for prior works he cited in this study. He also cites 33 more sources, also funded by the Pioneer Fund.

Oh, by the way, did I mention that this precise study has been heavily criticized because it fails to support, at any significant level, its hypothesis regarding the racial inferiority of blacks? The APA published a counter to it that uses the same data Jensen and Rushthon used, but, you know, actually doesn't p-hack. It comes to the conclusion that there is [not sufficient evidence to support Rushton's and Jensen's hypothesis](http://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/30years/Suzuki-Aronson-commentary-on-30years.pdf). Furthermore, once we used ""non-racist"" data sets collected by organizations that aren't funded by white supremacist dark money groups, we find that not only is Jensen &amp; Rushton (2005)'s hypothesis not supported by their own evidence, but it's [provably wrong at a 95% confidence interval](https://smile.amazon.com/Intelligence-How-Get-Schools-Cultures/dp/0393065057/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1480817362&amp;sr=1-1). 

Oh? And did I mention that the other coauthor of this work, Rushton, was the president of the [Pioneer Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Philippe_Rushton)? Yeah, really. It's an open secret in academics that these two guys collect donations from white supremacists, then use it to pay themselves to write racist works that then permit them to solicit more donations from angry white supremacists, the same way it's an open secret that climate change ""skeptics"" are very often bankrolled by the Koch Brothers or ExxonMobil. 

There are real arguments to be made about race and intelligence in any Sociology book regarding race an ethnicity. If you like, I can provide some of my favorites. They all contradict the white supremacist narrative, however. And, at least in my experience, people will say that's just the liberal academics lying to us.

The vibrating alarm is nice when I need to get up early and I don't want to wake up my girlfriend. I sucks that Apple doesn't have a native sleep tracking app yet, but I have used Pillow and Sleep++ (i think thats what it's called) and those are pretty decent for basic sleep tracking.

2) My Battery doesn't deplete much during the day, so when I wear it at night, I usually charge it when I take a shower (I have a series 1 so no water proofing) that usually gets it close to 100%. Otherwise I just charge it at night.

3) I have a 3rd party nylon band and I love it. I started with the black sport band, which isn't as comfortable as the nylon, but it holds a lot better with moisture. I would suggest getting a 3rd party sport band ( I hear good things about MoKo), then I would move up to a leather band or Milanese loop if that's something you'd be interested in.

4)The watch is great with sweat, but mine personally gets a little gunky around the edge of the glass of the heart rate monitor. I just take a q-tip and wipe it away every once in a while. 

5) My favorite apps actually happen to be the ones built in to the watch itself. Things like being able to set a timer, or control my music without taking out my phone. Very small things, but very convenient

6) I bought a watch/phone combo dock and I love it. I have this one https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XKPN5KO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1
I would suggest one, but it's entirely up to you

I first sanded down the black gloss with some fine sand paper on all sides except the bottom until the whole thing was a dull, flat black.
Then I painted both halves with a dark gray primer.
I then painted the top half with white since I didn't actually have a lighter gray, but it still looked pretty nice when all said and done.
Then I took a grate from the bottom of a Sega Genesis (I know right?) and taped the top piece of the case to the grate and used it as a template for the venting, painting the black strips all the way down the top.
I then masked off the middle area of the strips and down the sides of the now-black strips, leaving the 2 end points open and filled those in with black.
I matched up the bottom with the top and masked off the black strip for each side on the bottom of the case as well and simply painted those black.

Then I painted the whole thing over in a couple coats of gloss and finished it off with a chrome machine cut sticker from [here](https://www.etsy.com/listing/240588653/nintendo-nes-label-aufkleber-sticker?ref=listing-shop-header-1).

I agree with your conclusion that African Wars - like II Congo War - are usually discussed from the geo-political POV, very rarely from military POV. Exceptions are rather rare, regardless if it's about pre- or post-1990s, and so also in the case of such wars like that in Rwanda, or the I and II Congo Wars. For example, while there are dozens of books, and thousands of studies and articles about Rwanda, all I know - without a single exception - are dealing with the genocide of 1994. Until recently (see below) there was not one about military history of the Rwandan Civil War, 1990-1994. Similarly, books like those by Prunier are 'well known', while those discussing military campaigns appear 'non-existing'. 

Now, instead of explaining whys and hows, let me come to the point, i.e. offer you a few reading tips. Since you've explicitly requested '**post 1990 Africa**', in your place I would start with John W Turner's [Continent Ablaze](https://www.amazon.com/Continent-Ablaze-Insurgency-Africa-Present/dp/185409128X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482660101&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=continent+ablaze+turner). Yes, about 95% of that book is about pre-1990s, i.e. 'classic African wars', and post-1990s chapters are limited to those about Angola, actually. Furthermore, a lot of Turner's work is based on little else but reporting by BBC's Foreign Monitoring Service and similar 'sources'. But, you'll learn a lot about most of reasons for post-1990s wars. Plus, it's one of less than a handful of books covering African wars one can find in libraries of such places like Sandhurst, so I would describe it as a 'good starter'. If nothing else, it's going to help you find out what wars do you want to follow closely. 

Casual search around the internet might bring you to various books by Al J Venter, a veteran South African author of works like [War Dog](https://www.amazon.com/War-Dog-Fighting-Peoples-Mercenary/dp/1932033904/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482660429&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=al+venter), [Gunship Ace](https://www.amazon.com/Gunship-Ace-Neall-Helicopter-Mercenary/dp/1612000703/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482660429&amp;sr=8-12&amp;keywords=al+venter), or [Barrel of a Gun](https://www.amazon.com/Barrel-Gun-Correspondents-Misspent-Moments/dp/1935149253/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482660429&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=al+venter). These are including a great deal of 'episodes' related to South African mercenaries in places like Congo, Sierra Leone, Angola etc. Al was in all of these places, and is personally befriended to most of crucial actors, and thus simply 'unbeatable' in regards of 'details'. What one might miss in his books though, would be for these stories to be put within their geopolitical and military context, i.e. a slightly better organization of all the data they're presenting. But then, that's simply a matter of taste. 

Still, if you follow 'Al's trail', you might stumble into a small South African publisher titled [30 Degrees South](http://www.30degreessouth.co.za/) - and thus find out this has published a number of titles penned by Eeben Barlow. 

Clearly, while Barlow is well-known (or at least 'Executive Outcomes' is going to ring plenty of bells here, so I'm sure), his top military planners and tacticians like Roelf van Heerden and Andrew Hudson remain entirely unknown in the public - although at least the latter has published a number of his own titles, mostly via 30 Deg South (just check their website). 

Further search for the latter might bring you to a series of books published in cooperation between 30 Deg South and [Helion Publishing](http://www.helion.co.uk/) (UK) since some 6-7 years and appropriately titled '[Africa@War](http://www.30degreessouth.co.za/africa_war.htm)'. They've released about 25 titles so far. Of course, majority of these went into 'classic' topics from the 1960s-1980s - i.e. those related to South Africa, Rhodesia, Portuguese campaigns in the Guine, Angola, or mercenaries in the Congo etc. But, meanwhile they've brought out quite a number of titles about 'other' African wars out, and especially those about conflicts since 1990s - including such like [Somalia, US Intervention, 1992-1994](https://www.amazon.com/Somalia-Intervention-1992-1994-Africa-War/dp/1909384615/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482661860&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=somalia+africa%40war), or the much postponed [AMISOM](https://www.amazon.com/AMISOM-Battle-Somalia-2006-2013-Africa/dp/1909384674/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482661773&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=amisom+africa%40war). 

Guess, this is the point at which I must beg admins for some more of their understanding (perhaps even some 'sympathy'), then because of my own involvement the following is going to appear as another post full of 'shameless self-advertising'. Namely, I do happen to have researched quite a lot about modern-day African wars (often with help from kind people like Andrew, Al and many others) and so I have joined the gang of Africa@War and published several titles in that series, often in cooperation with my Swiss friend Adrien Fontanelaz. That's how an entire series of books explaining the military history of conflicts related to the II Congo War came into being, including: 

- [Wars and Insurgencies of Uganda, 1971-1994](https://www.amazon.com/Wars-Insurgencies-Uganda-1971-1994-Africa/dp/1910294551/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482661297&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=wars+and+insurgencies+of+uganda) (story of the Ugandan military build-up through 1960s and 1970s; the Kagera War of 1978-1979, and of various insurgencies of the 1980s and 1990s, some of which in turn were instrumental for the following volume)

- [The Rwandan Patriotic Front, 1990-1994](https://www.amazon.com/Rwandan-Patriotic-Front-1990-1994-Africa/dp/191029456X/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=BH7SPCDRTHZS5771D2V8) (wars in Ugandas proved crucial for what happened in Rwanda of the early 1990s; namely, already Museveni's NRA was heavily dependent on hundreds of Rwandan Tutsis, who in turn created the Rwandan Patriotic Front and invaded Rwanda in 1990, launching a civil war that... well, is de-facto still going on, 'but', kind of 'culminated' with the genocide of 1994)

- [Great Lakes Holocaust: I Congo War, 1996-1997](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Lakes-Holocaust-1996-1997-Africa/dp/1909384658/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482661505&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=great+lakes+holocaust) (in 1996, Rwanda, followed by Uganda, launched an invasion of the then Zaire, eventually toppling US/French-supported dictator Mobutu Sese-Seko; this is the story of that conflict), and 

- [Great Lakes Conflagration: II Congo War, 1998-2003](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Lakes-Conflagration-Second-1998-2003/dp/1909384666/ref=pd_sim_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=BNV4E03AGSKX0B5XCQ2W) (in 1998, Rwanda and Uganda launched their second invasion of the DR Congo, this time attempting not only to topple President Kabila, but also establish themselves in control over immense mineral wealth in the east of that country; this in turn prompted a counter-intervention by Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia - and even Libyan-sponsored Chad, plus few other countries; what is next-to-unknown is that this war kind of 'faded away' not only because of highly-published  series of major clashes between Ugandans and Rwandans related to distribution of the loot, but especially because the Congolese began applying the same strategy upon Rwandans, which Rwandans used to apply on the Congolese, early during that war). 

I did originally intend to follow-up with a third volume on the DR Congo since 2003, but sad point is: as much as they are praised by all of their readers, the latter remain very limited in numbers. My understanding of the reasons is that these books are neither sensationalist, nor discussing usual topics like mass suffering of civilians, but rather dry military histories of conflicts in question. And since majority of potential readers cannot imagine - just for example - Zimbabweans deploying their adaptation of Rhodesian 'Fire Force tactics' in the centre of the DR Congo of 1998, they never come to the idea that there are any kind of books discussing such topics. Unsurprisingly, I doubt we've sold more than 500 copies of any of these titles, which in turn means they simply do not pay. For similar reasons, I dropped the idea of preparing similar volumes on topics like Sudan or Chad, just for example. Slightly more successful was the [Libyan Air Wars](https://www.amazon.com/Libyan-Air-Wars-Part-1986-1989/dp/1910294543/ref=pd_sim_14_3?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=2MZV4SZV1MNB7J2XQ1JH) mini-series (3 titles); that might eventually 'provoke' me to ready a title (or two) on 'Libya since 2011' (there're certainly enough sources and info, especially thanks to research by Arnaud Delalande). We'll see... 

Fans of obscure (indeed: often enough 'weird') air forces and their (frequently: 'colourful') aircraft have found the two-part study [African MiGs](https://www.amazon.com/African-MiGs-Madagascar-Zimbabwe-Sub-Saharan/dp/0982553986/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482662268&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=african+migs) slightly more interesting (indeed, even the library at Wright Patterson should have a copy of each). Except for discussing acquisitions and operational history of its title, it's also providing - often quite lengthy - summaries of local air forces at wars, so also those since 1990 (just for example, I do not know any other book discussing COIN ops by the Ugandan People's Defence Force/Air Force against Lord's Resistance Army since 2000). 'Bonus', if you like: Volume 2 ends with a big appendix providing a detailed ORBAT of 23 African air forces as of 2010 (with exception of Mozambique and Mali, not much changed ever since).

Casual search around the internet might bring you to various books by Al J Venter, a veteran South African author of works like [War Dog](https://www.amazon.com/War-Dog-Fighting-Peoples-Mercenary/dp/1932033904/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482660429&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=al+venter), [Gunship Ace](https://www.amazon.com/Gunship-Ace-Neall-Helicopter-Mercenary/dp/1612000703/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482660429&amp;sr=8-12&amp;keywords=al+venter), or [Barrel of a Gun](https://www.amazon.com/Barrel-Gun-Correspondents-Misspent-Moments/dp/1935149253/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482660429&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=al+venter). These are including a great deal of 'episodes' related to South African mercenaries in places like Congo, Sierra Leone, Angola etc. Al was in all of these places, and is personally befriended to most of crucial actors, and thus simply 'unbeatable' in regards of 'details'. What one might miss in his books though, would be for these stories to be put within their geopolitical and military context, i.e. a slightly better organization of all the data they're presenting. But then, that's simply a matter of taste. 

Still, if you follow 'Al's trail', you might stumble into a small South African publisher titled [30 Degrees South](http://www.30degreessouth.co.za/) - and thus find out this has published a number of titles penned by Eeben Barlow. 

Clearly, while Barlow is well-known (or at least 'Executive Outcomes' is going to ring plenty of bells here, so I'm sure), his top military planners and tacticians like Roelf van Heerden and Andrew Hudson remain entirely unknown in the public - although at least the latter has published a number of his own titles, mostly via 30 Deg South (just check their website). 

Further search for the latter might bring you to a series of books published in cooperation between 30 Deg South and [Helion Publishing](http://www.helion.co.uk/) (UK) since some 6-7 years and appropriately titled '[Africa@War](http://www.30degreessouth.co.za/africa_war.htm)'. They've released about 25 titles so far. Of course, majority of these went into 'classic' topics from the 1960s-1980s - i.e. those related to South Africa, Rhodesia, Portuguese campaigns in the Guine, Angola, or mercenaries in the Congo etc. But, meanwhile they've brought out quite a number of titles about 'other' African wars out, and especially those about conflicts since 1990s - including such like [Somalia, US Intervention, 1992-1994](https://www.amazon.com/Somalia-Intervention-1992-1994-Africa-War/dp/1909384615/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482661860&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=somalia+africa%40war), or the much postponed [AMISOM](https://www.amazon.com/AMISOM-Battle-Somalia-2006-2013-Africa/dp/1909384674/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482661773&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=amisom+africa%40war). 

Guess, this is the point at which I must beg admins for some more of their understanding (perhaps even some 'sympathy'), then because of my own involvement the following is going to appear as another post full of 'shameless self-advertising'. Namely, I do happen to have researched quite a lot about modern-day African wars (often with help from kind people like Andrew, Al and many others) and so I have joined the gang of Africa@War and published several titles in that series, often in cooperation with my Swiss friend Adrien Fontanelaz. That's how an entire series of books explaining the military history of conflicts related to the II Congo War came into being, including: 

- [Wars and Insurgencies of Uganda, 1971-1994](https://www.amazon.com/Wars-Insurgencies-Uganda-1971-1994-Africa/dp/1910294551/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482661297&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=wars+and+insurgencies+of+uganda) (story of the Ugandan military build-up through 1960s and 1970s; the Kagera War of 1978-1979, and of various insurgencies of the 1980s and 1990s, some of which in turn were instrumental for the following volume)

- [The Rwandan Patriotic Front, 1990-1994](https://www.amazon.com/Rwandan-Patriotic-Front-1990-1994-Africa/dp/191029456X/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=BH7SPCDRTHZS5771D2V8) (wars in Ugandas proved crucial for what happened in Rwanda of the early 1990s; namely, already Museveni's NRA was heavily dependent on hundreds of Rwandan Tutsis, who in turn created the Rwandan Patriotic Front and invaded Rwanda in 1990, launching a civil war that... well, is de-facto still going on, 'but', kind of 'culminated' with the genocide of 1994)

- [Great Lakes Holocaust: I Congo War, 1996-1997](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Lakes-Holocaust-1996-1997-Africa/dp/1909384658/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482661505&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=great+lakes+holocaust) (in 1996, Rwanda, followed by Uganda, launched an invasion of the then Zaire, eventually toppling US/French-supported dictator Mobutu Sese-Seko; this is the story of that conflict), and 

- [Great Lakes Conflagration: II Congo War, 1998-2003](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Lakes-Conflagration-Second-1998-2003/dp/1909384666/ref=pd_sim_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=BNV4E03AGSKX0B5XCQ2W) (in 1998, Rwanda and Uganda launched their second invasion of the DR Congo, this time attempting not only to topple President Kabila, but also establish themselves in control over immense mineral wealth in the east of that country; this in turn prompted a counter-intervention by Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia - and even Libyan-sponsored Chad, plus few other countries; what is next-to-unknown is that this war kind of 'faded away' not only because of highly-published  series of major clashes between Ugandans and Rwandans related to distribution of the loot, but especially because the Congolese began applying the same strategy upon Rwandans, which Rwandans used to apply on the Congolese, early during that war). 

I did originally intend to follow-up with a third volume on the DR Congo since 2003, but sad point is: as much as they are praised by all of their readers, the latter remain very limited in numbers. My understanding of the reasons is that these books are neither sensationalist, nor discussing usual topics like mass suffering of civilians, but rather dry military histories of conflicts in question. And since majority of potential readers cannot imagine - just for example - Zimbabweans deploying their adaptation of Rhodesian 'Fire Force tactics' in the centre of the DR Congo of 1998, they never come to the idea that there are any kind of books discussing such topics. Unsurprisingly, I doubt we've sold more than 500 copies of any of these titles, which in turn means they simply do not pay. For similar reasons, I dropped the idea of preparing similar volumes on topics like Sudan or Chad, just for example. Slightly more successful was the [Libyan Air Wars](https://www.amazon.com/Libyan-Air-Wars-Part-1986-1989/dp/1910294543/ref=pd_sim_14_3?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=2MZV4SZV1MNB7J2XQ1JH) mini-series (3 titles); that might eventually 'provoke' me to ready a title (or two) on 'Libya since 2011' (there're certainly enough sources and info, especially thanks to research by Arnaud Delalande). We'll see... 

Fans of obscure (indeed: often enough 'weird') air forces and their (frequently: 'colourful') aircraft have found the two-part study [African MiGs](https://www.amazon.com/African-MiGs-Madagascar-Zimbabwe-Sub-Saharan/dp/0982553986/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482662268&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=african+migs) slightly more interesting (indeed, even the library at Wright Patterson should have a copy of each). Except for discussing acquisitions and operational history of its title, it's also providing - often quite lengthy - summaries of local air forces at wars, so also those since 1990 (just for example, I do not know any other book discussing COIN ops by the Ugandan People's Defence Force/Air Force against Lord's Resistance Army since 2000). 'Bonus', if you like: Volume 2 ends with a big appendix providing a detailed ORBAT of 23 African air forces as of 2010 (with exception of Mozambique and Mali, not much changed ever since).

I agree with your conclusion that African Wars - like II Congo War - are usually discussed from the geo-political POV, very rarely from military POV. Exceptions are rather rare, regardless if it's about pre- or post-1990s, and so also in the case of such wars like that in Rwanda, or the I and II Congo Wars. For example, while there are dozens of books, and thousands of studies and articles about Rwanda, all I know - without a single exception - are dealing with the genocide of 1994. Until recently (see below) there was not one about military history of the Rwandan Civil War, 1990-1994. Similarly, books like those by Prunier are 'well known', while those discussing military campaigns appear 'non-existing'. 

Now, instead of explaining whys and hows, let me come to the point, i.e. offer you a few reading tips. Since you've explicitly requested '**post 1990 Africa**', in your place I would start with John W Turner's [Continent Ablaze](https://www.amazon.com/Continent-Ablaze-Insurgency-Africa-Present/dp/185409128X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482660101&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=continent+ablaze+turner). Yes, about 95% of that book is about pre-1990s, i.e. 'classic African wars', and post-1990s chapters are limited to those about Angola, actually. Furthermore, a lot of Turner's work is based on little else but reporting by BBC's Foreign Monitoring Service and similar 'sources'. But, you'll learn a lot about most of reasons for post-1990s wars. Plus, it's one of less than a handful of books covering African wars one can find in libraries of such places like Sandhurst, so I would describe it as a 'good starter'. If nothing else, it's going to help you find out what wars do you want to follow closely.

- [Wars and Insurgencies of Uganda, 1971-1994](https://www.amazon.com/Wars-Insurgencies-Uganda-1971-1994-Africa/dp/1910294551/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482661297&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=wars+and+insurgencies+of+uganda) (story of the Ugandan military build-up through 1960s and 1970s; the Kagera War of 1978-1979, and of various insurgencies of the 1980s and 1990s, some of which in turn were instrumental for the following volume)

- [The Rwandan Patriotic Front, 1990-1994](https://www.amazon.com/Rwandan-Patriotic-Front-1990-1994-Africa/dp/191029456X/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=BH7SPCDRTHZS5771D2V8) (wars in Ugandas proved crucial for what happened in Rwanda of the early 1990s; namely, already Museveni's NRA was heavily dependent on hundreds of Rwandan Tutsis, who in turn created the Rwandan Patriotic Front and invaded Rwanda in 1990, launching a civil war that... well, is de-facto still going on, 'but', kind of 'culminated' with the genocide of 1994)

- [Great Lakes Holocaust: I Congo War, 1996-1997](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Lakes-Holocaust-1996-1997-Africa/dp/1909384658/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482661505&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=great+lakes+holocaust) (in 1996, Rwanda, followed by Uganda, launched an invasion of the then Zaire, eventually toppling US/French-supported dictator Mobutu Sese-Seko; this is the story of that conflict), and 

- [Great Lakes Conflagration: II Congo War, 1998-2003](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Lakes-Conflagration-Second-1998-2003/dp/1909384666/ref=pd_sim_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=BNV4E03AGSKX0B5XCQ2W) (in 1998, Rwanda and Uganda launched their second invasion of the DR Congo, this time attempting not only to topple President Kabila, but also establish themselves in control over immense mineral wealth in the east of that country; this in turn prompted a counter-intervention by Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia - and even Libyan-sponsored Chad, plus few other countries; what is next-to-unknown is that this war kind of 'faded away' not only because of highly-published  series of major clashes between Ugandans and Rwandans related to distribution of the loot, but especially because the Congolese began applying the same strategy upon Rwandans, which Rwandans used to apply on the Congolese, early during that war). 

I did originally intend to follow-up with a third volume on the DR Congo since 2003, but sad point is: as much as they are praised by all of their readers, the latter remain very limited in numbers. My understanding of the reasons is that these books are neither sensationalist, nor discussing usual topics like mass suffering of civilians, but rather dry military histories of conflicts in question. And since majority of potential readers cannot imagine - just for example - Zimbabweans deploying their adaptation of Rhodesian 'Fire Force tactics' in the centre of the DR Congo of 1998, they never come to the idea that there are any kind of books discussing such topics. Unsurprisingly, I doubt we've sold more than 500 copies of any of these titles, which in turn means they simply do not pay. For similar reasons, I dropped the idea of preparing similar volumes on topics like Sudan or Chad, just for example. Slightly more successful was the [Libyan Air Wars](https://www.amazon.com/Libyan-Air-Wars-Part-1986-1989/dp/1910294543/ref=pd_sim_14_3?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=2MZV4SZV1MNB7J2XQ1JH) mini-series (3 titles); that might eventually 'provoke' me to ready a title (or two) on 'Libya since 2011' (there're certainly enough sources and info, especially thanks to research by Arnaud Delalande). We'll see... 

Fans of obscure (indeed: often enough 'weird') air forces and their (frequently: 'colourful') aircraft have found the two-part study [African MiGs](https://www.amazon.com/African-MiGs-Madagascar-Zimbabwe-Sub-Saharan/dp/0982553986/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482662268&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=african+migs) slightly more interesting (indeed, even the library at Wright Patterson should have a copy of each). Except for discussing acquisitions and operational history of its title, it's also providing - often quite lengthy - summaries of local air forces at wars, so also those since 1990 (just for example, I do not know any other book discussing COIN ops by the Ugandan People's Defence Force/Air Force against Lord's Resistance Army since 2000). 'Bonus', if you like: Volume 2 ends with a big appendix providing a detailed ORBAT of 23 African air forces as of 2010 (with exception of Mozambique and Mali, not much changed ever since).

I agree with your conclusion that African Wars - like II Congo War - are usually discussed from the geo-political POV, very rarely from military POV. Exceptions are rather rare, regardless if it's about pre- or post-1990s, and so also in the case of such wars like that in Rwanda, or the I and II Congo Wars. For example, while there are dozens of books, and thousands of studies and articles about Rwanda, all I know - without a single exception - are dealing with the genocide of 1994. Until recently (see below) there was not one about military history of the Rwandan Civil War, 1990-1994. Similarly, books like those by Prunier are 'well known', while those discussing military campaigns appear 'non-existing'. 

Now, instead of explaining whys and hows, let me come to the point, i.e. offer you a few reading tips. Since you've explicitly requested '**post 1990 Africa**', in your place I would start with John W Turner's [Continent Ablaze](https://www.amazon.com/Continent-Ablaze-Insurgency-Africa-Present/dp/185409128X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482660101&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=continent+ablaze+turner). Yes, about 95% of that book is about pre-1990s, i.e. 'classic African wars', and post-1990s chapters are limited to those about Angola, actually. Furthermore, a lot of Turner's work is based on little else but reporting by BBC's Foreign Monitoring Service and similar 'sources'. But, you'll learn a lot about most of reasons for post-1990s wars. Plus, it's one of less than a handful of books covering African wars one can find in libraries of such places like Sandhurst, so I would describe it as a 'good starter'. If nothing else, it's going to help you find out what wars do you want to follow closely. 

Casual search around the internet might bring you to various books by Al J Venter, a veteran South African author of works like [War Dog](https://www.amazon.com/War-Dog-Fighting-Peoples-Mercenary/dp/1932033904/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482660429&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=al+venter), [Gunship Ace](https://www.amazon.com/Gunship-Ace-Neall-Helicopter-Mercenary/dp/1612000703/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482660429&amp;sr=8-12&amp;keywords=al+venter), or [Barrel of a Gun](https://www.amazon.com/Barrel-Gun-Correspondents-Misspent-Moments/dp/1935149253/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482660429&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=al+venter). These are including a great deal of 'episodes' related to South African mercenaries in places like Congo, Sierra Leone, Angola etc. Al was in all of these places, and is personally befriended to most of crucial actors, and thus simply 'unbeatable' in regards of 'details'. What one might miss in his books though, would be for these stories to be put within their geopolitical and military context, i.e. a slightly better organization of all the data they're presenting. But then, that's simply a matter of taste. 

Still, if you follow 'Al's trail', you might stumble into a small South African publisher titled [30 Degrees South](http://www.30degreessouth.co.za/) - and thus find out this has published a number of titles penned by Eeben Barlow. 

Clearly, while Barlow is well-known (or at least 'Executive Outcomes' is going to ring plenty of bells here, so I'm sure), his top military planners and tacticians like Roelf van Heerden and Andrew Hudson remain entirely unknown in the public - although at least the latter has published a number of his own titles, mostly via 30 Deg South (just check their website). 

Further search for the latter might bring you to a series of books published in cooperation between 30 Deg South and [Helion Publishing](http://www.helion.co.uk/) (UK) since some 6-7 years and appropriately titled '[Africa@War](http://www.30degreessouth.co.za/africa_war.htm)'. They've released about 25 titles so far. Of course, majority of these went into 'classic' topics from the 1960s-1980s - i.e. those related to South Africa, Rhodesia, Portuguese campaigns in the Guine, Angola, or mercenaries in the Congo etc. But, meanwhile they've brought out quite a number of titles about 'other' African wars out, and especially those about conflicts since 1990s - including such like [Somalia, US Intervention, 1992-1994](https://www.amazon.com/Somalia-Intervention-1992-1994-Africa-War/dp/1909384615/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482661860&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=somalia+africa%40war), or the much postponed [AMISOM](https://www.amazon.com/AMISOM-Battle-Somalia-2006-2013-Africa/dp/1909384674/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482661773&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=amisom+africa%40war). 

Guess, this is the point at which I must beg admins for some more of their understanding (perhaps even some 'sympathy'), then because of my own involvement the following is going to appear as another post full of 'shameless self-advertising'. Namely, I do happen to have researched quite a lot about modern-day African wars (often with help from kind people like Andrew, Al and many others) and so I have joined the gang of Africa@War and published several titles in that series, often in cooperation with my Swiss friend Adrien Fontanelaz.

Fans of obscure (indeed: often enough 'weird') air forces and their (frequently: 'colourful') aircraft have found the two-part study [African MiGs](https://www.amazon.com/African-MiGs-Madagascar-Zimbabwe-Sub-Saharan/dp/0982553986/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482662268&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=african+migs) slightly more interesting (indeed, even the library at Wright Patterson should have a copy of each). Except for discussing acquisitions and operational history of its title, it's also providing - often quite lengthy - summaries of local air forces at wars, so also those since 1990 (just for example, I do not know any other book discussing COIN ops by the Ugandan People's Defence Force/Air Force against Lord's Resistance Army since 2000). 'Bonus', if you like: Volume 2 ends with a big appendix providing a detailed ORBAT of 23 African air forces as of 2010 (with exception of Mozambique and Mali, not much changed ever since).

I agree with your conclusion that African Wars - like II Congo War - are usually discussed from the geo-political POV, very rarely from military POV. Exceptions are rather rare, regardless if it's about pre- or post-1990s, and so also in the case of such wars like that in Rwanda, or the I and II Congo Wars. For example, while there are dozens of books, and thousands of studies and articles about Rwanda, all I know - without a single exception - are dealing with the genocide of 1994. Until recently (see below) there was not one about military history of the Rwandan Civil War, 1990-1994. Similarly, books like those by Prunier are 'well known', while those discussing military campaigns appear 'non-existing'. 

Now, instead of explaining whys and hows, let me come to the point, i.e. offer you a few reading tips. Since you've explicitly requested '**post 1990 Africa**', in your place I would start with John W Turner's [Continent Ablaze](https://www.amazon.com/Continent-Ablaze-Insurgency-Africa-Present/dp/185409128X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482660101&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=continent+ablaze+turner). Yes, about 95% of that book is about pre-1990s, i.e. 'classic African wars', and post-1990s chapters are limited to those about Angola, actually. Furthermore, a lot of Turner's work is based on little else but reporting by BBC's Foreign Monitoring Service and similar 'sources'. But, you'll learn a lot about most of reasons for post-1990s wars. Plus, it's one of less than a handful of books covering African wars one can find in libraries of such places like Sandhurst, so I would describe it as a 'good starter'. If nothing else, it's going to help you find out what wars do you want to follow closely. 

Casual search around the internet might bring you to various books by Al J Venter, a veteran South African author of works like [War Dog](https://www.amazon.com/War-Dog-Fighting-Peoples-Mercenary/dp/1932033904/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482660429&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=al+venter), [Gunship Ace](https://www.amazon.com/Gunship-Ace-Neall-Helicopter-Mercenary/dp/1612000703/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482660429&amp;sr=8-12&amp;keywords=al+venter), or [Barrel of a Gun](https://www.amazon.com/Barrel-Gun-Correspondents-Misspent-Moments/dp/1935149253/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482660429&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=al+venter). These are including a great deal of 'episodes' related to South African mercenaries in places like Congo, Sierra Leone, Angola etc. Al was in all of these places, and is personally befriended to most of crucial actors, and thus simply 'unbeatable' in regards of 'details'. What one might miss in his books though, would be for these stories to be put within their geopolitical and military context, i.e. a slightly better organization of all the data they're presenting. But then, that's simply a matter of taste. 

Still, if you follow 'Al's trail', you might stumble into a small South African publisher titled [30 Degrees South](http://www.30degreessouth.co.za/) - and thus find out this has published a number of titles penned by Eeben Barlow. 

Clearly, while Barlow is well-known (or at least 'Executive Outcomes' is going to ring plenty of bells here, so I'm sure), his top military planners and tacticians like Roelf van Heerden and Andrew Hudson remain entirely unknown in the public - although at least the latter has published a number of his own titles, mostly via 30 Deg South (just check their website). 

Further search for the latter might bring you to a series of books published in cooperation between 30 Deg South and [Helion Publishing](http://www.helion.co.uk/) (UK) since some 6-7 years and appropriately titled '[Africa@War](http://www.30degreessouth.co.za/africa_war.htm)'. They've released about 25 titles so far. Of course, majority of these went into 'classic' topics from the 1960s-1980s - i.e. those related to South Africa, Rhodesia, Portuguese campaigns in the Guine, Angola, or mercenaries in the Congo etc. But, meanwhile they've brought out quite a number of titles about 'other' African wars out, and especially those about conflicts since 1990s - including such like [Somalia, US Intervention, 1992-1994](https://www.amazon.com/Somalia-Intervention-1992-1994-Africa-War/dp/1909384615/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482661860&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=somalia+africa%40war), or the much postponed [AMISOM](https://www.amazon.com/AMISOM-Battle-Somalia-2006-2013-Africa/dp/1909384674/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482661773&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=amisom+africa%40war). 

Guess, this is the point at which I must beg admins for some more of their understanding (perhaps even some 'sympathy'), then because of my own involvement the following is going to appear as another post full of 'shameless self-advertising'. Namely, I do happen to have researched quite a lot about modern-day African wars (often with help from kind people like Andrew, Al and many others) and so I have joined the gang of Africa@War and published several titles in that series, often in cooperation with my Swiss friend Adrien Fontanelaz. That's how an entire series of books explaining the military history of conflicts related to the II Congo War came into being, including: 

- [Wars and Insurgencies of Uganda, 1971-1994](https://www.amazon.com/Wars-Insurgencies-Uganda-1971-1994-Africa/dp/1910294551/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482661297&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=wars+and+insurgencies+of+uganda) (story of the Ugandan military build-up through 1960s and 1970s; the Kagera War of 1978-1979, and of various insurgencies of the 1980s and 1990s, some of which in turn were instrumental for the following volume)

- [The Rwandan Patriotic Front, 1990-1994](https://www.amazon.com/Rwandan-Patriotic-Front-1990-1994-Africa/dp/191029456X/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=BH7SPCDRTHZS5771D2V8) (wars in Ugandas proved crucial for what happened in Rwanda of the early 1990s; namely, already Museveni's NRA was heavily dependent on hundreds of Rwandan Tutsis, who in turn created the Rwandan Patriotic Front and invaded Rwanda in 1990, launching a civil war that... well, is de-facto still going on, 'but', kind of 'culminated' with the genocide of 1994)

- [Great Lakes Holocaust: I Congo War, 1996-1997](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Lakes-Holocaust-1996-1997-Africa/dp/1909384658/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482661505&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=great+lakes+holocaust) (in 1996, Rwanda, followed by Uganda, launched an invasion of the then Zaire, eventually toppling US/French-supported dictator Mobutu Sese-Seko; this is the story of that conflict), and 

- [Great Lakes Conflagration: II Congo War, 1998-2003](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Lakes-Conflagration-Second-1998-2003/dp/1909384666/ref=pd_sim_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=BNV4E03AGSKX0B5XCQ2W) (in 1998, Rwanda and Uganda launched their second invasion of the DR Congo, this time attempting not only to topple President Kabila, but also establish themselves in control over immense mineral wealth in the east of that country; this in turn prompted a counter-intervention by Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia - and even Libyan-sponsored Chad, plus few other countries; what is next-to-unknown is that this war kind of 'faded away' not only because of highly-published  series of major clashes between Ugandans and Rwandans related to distribution of the loot, but especially because the Congolese began applying the same strategy upon Rwandans, which Rwandans used to apply on the Congolese, early during that war). 

I did originally intend to follow-up with a third volume on the DR Congo since 2003, but sad point is: as much as they are praised by all of their readers, the latter remain very limited in numbers. My understanding of the reasons is that these books are neither sensationalist, nor discussing usual topics like mass suffering of civilians, but rather dry military histories of conflicts in question. And since majority of potential readers cannot imagine - just for example - Zimbabweans deploying their adaptation of Rhodesian 'Fire Force tactics' in the centre of the DR Congo of 1998, they never come to the idea that there are any kind of books discussing such topics. Unsurprisingly, I doubt we've sold more than 500 copies of any of these titles, which in turn means they simply do not pay. For similar reasons, I dropped the idea of preparing similar volumes on topics like Sudan or Chad, just for example. Slightly more successful was the [Libyan Air Wars](https://www.amazon.com/Libyan-Air-Wars-Part-1986-1989/dp/1910294543/ref=pd_sim_14_3?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=2MZV4SZV1MNB7J2XQ1JH) mini-series (3 titles); that might eventually 'provoke' me to ready a title (or two) on 'Libya since 2011' (there're certainly enough sources and info, especially thanks to research by Arnaud Delalande).

Plus, it's one of less than a handful of books covering African wars one can find in libraries of such places like Sandhurst, so I would describe it as a 'good starter'. If nothing else, it's going to help you find out what wars do you want to follow closely. 

Casual search around the internet might bring you to various books by Al J Venter, a veteran South African author of works like [War Dog](https://www.amazon.com/War-Dog-Fighting-Peoples-Mercenary/dp/1932033904/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482660429&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=al+venter), [Gunship Ace](https://www.amazon.com/Gunship-Ace-Neall-Helicopter-Mercenary/dp/1612000703/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482660429&amp;sr=8-12&amp;keywords=al+venter), or [Barrel of a Gun](https://www.amazon.com/Barrel-Gun-Correspondents-Misspent-Moments/dp/1935149253/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482660429&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=al+venter). These are including a great deal of 'episodes' related to South African mercenaries in places like Congo, Sierra Leone, Angola etc. Al was in all of these places, and is personally befriended to most of crucial actors, and thus simply 'unbeatable' in regards of 'details'. What one might miss in his books though, would be for these stories to be put within their geopolitical and military context, i.e. a slightly better organization of all the data they're presenting. But then, that's simply a matter of taste. 

Still, if you follow 'Al's trail', you might stumble into a small South African publisher titled [30 Degrees South](http://www.30degreessouth.co.za/) - and thus find out this has published a number of titles penned by Eeben Barlow. 

Clearly, while Barlow is well-known (or at least 'Executive Outcomes' is going to ring plenty of bells here, so I'm sure), his top military planners and tacticians like Roelf van Heerden and Andrew Hudson remain entirely unknown in the public - although at least the latter has published a number of his own titles, mostly via 30 Deg South (just check their website). 

Further search for the latter might bring you to a series of books published in cooperation between 30 Deg South and [Helion Publishing](http://www.helion.co.uk/) (UK) since some 6-7 years and appropriately titled '[Africa@War](http://www.30degreessouth.co.za/africa_war.htm)'. They've released about 25 titles so far. Of course, majority of these went into 'classic' topics from the 1960s-1980s - i.e. those related to South Africa, Rhodesia, Portuguese campaigns in the Guine, Angola, or mercenaries in the Congo etc. But, meanwhile they've brought out quite a number of titles about 'other' African wars out, and especially those about conflicts since 1990s - including such like [Somalia, US Intervention, 1992-1994](https://www.amazon.com/Somalia-Intervention-1992-1994-Africa-War/dp/1909384615/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482661860&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=somalia+africa%40war), or the much postponed [AMISOM](https://www.amazon.com/AMISOM-Battle-Somalia-2006-2013-Africa/dp/1909384674/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482661773&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=amisom+africa%40war). 

Guess, this is the point at which I must beg admins for some more of their understanding (perhaps even some 'sympathy'), then because of my own involvement the following is going to appear as another post full of 'shameless self-advertising'. Namely, I do happen to have researched quite a lot about modern-day African wars (often with help from kind people like Andrew, Al and many others) and so I have joined the gang of Africa@War and published several titles in that series, often in cooperation with my Swiss friend Adrien Fontanelaz. That's how an entire series of books explaining the military history of conflicts related to the II Congo War came into being, including: 

- [Wars and Insurgencies of Uganda, 1971-1994](https://www.amazon.com/Wars-Insurgencies-Uganda-1971-1994-Africa/dp/1910294551/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482661297&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=wars+and+insurgencies+of+uganda) (story of the Ugandan military build-up through 1960s and 1970s; the Kagera War of 1978-1979, and of various insurgencies of the 1980s and 1990s, some of which in turn were instrumental for the following volume)

- [The Rwandan Patriotic Front, 1990-1994](https://www.amazon.com/Rwandan-Patriotic-Front-1990-1994-Africa/dp/191029456X/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=BH7SPCDRTHZS5771D2V8) (wars in Ugandas proved crucial for what happened in Rwanda of the early 1990s; namely, already Museveni's NRA was heavily dependent on hundreds of Rwandan Tutsis, who in turn created the Rwandan Patriotic Front and invaded Rwanda in 1990, launching a civil war that... well, is de-facto still going on, 'but', kind of 'culminated' with the genocide of 1994)

- [Great Lakes Holocaust: I Congo War, 1996-1997](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Lakes-Holocaust-1996-1997-Africa/dp/1909384658/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482661505&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=great+lakes+holocaust) (in 1996, Rwanda, followed by Uganda, launched an invasion of the then Zaire, eventually toppling US/French-supported dictator Mobutu Sese-Seko; this is the story of that conflict), and 

- [Great Lakes Conflagration: II Congo War, 1998-2003](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Lakes-Conflagration-Second-1998-2003/dp/1909384666/ref=pd_sim_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=BNV4E03AGSKX0B5XCQ2W) (in 1998, Rwanda and Uganda launched their second invasion of the DR Congo, this time attempting not only to topple President Kabila, but also establish themselves in control over immense mineral wealth in the east of that country; this in turn prompted a counter-intervention by Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia - and even Libyan-sponsored Chad, plus few other countries; what is next-to-unknown is that this war kind of 'faded away' not only because of highly-published  series of major clashes between Ugandans and Rwandans related to distribution of the loot, but especially because the Congolese began applying the same strategy upon Rwandans, which Rwandans used to apply on the Congolese, early during that war). 

I did originally intend to follow-up with a third volume on the DR Congo since 2003, but sad point is: as much as they are praised by all of their readers, the latter remain very limited in numbers. My understanding of the reasons is that these books are neither sensationalist, nor discussing usual topics like mass suffering of civilians, but rather dry military histories of conflicts in question. And since majority of potential readers cannot imagine - just for example - Zimbabweans deploying their adaptation of Rhodesian 'Fire Force tactics' in the centre of the DR Congo of 1998, they never come to the idea that there are any kind of books discussing such topics. Unsurprisingly, I doubt we've sold more than 500 copies of any of these titles, which in turn means they simply do not pay. For similar reasons, I dropped the idea of preparing similar volumes on topics like Sudan or Chad, just for example. Slightly more successful was the [Libyan Air Wars](https://www.amazon.com/Libyan-Air-Wars-Part-1986-1989/dp/1910294543/ref=pd_sim_14_3?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=2MZV4SZV1MNB7J2XQ1JH) mini-series (3 titles); that might eventually 'provoke' me to ready a title (or two) on 'Libya since 2011' (there're certainly enough sources and info, especially thanks to research by Arnaud Delalande). We'll see... 

Fans of obscure (indeed: often enough 'weird') air forces and their (frequently: 'colourful') aircraft have found the two-part study [African MiGs](https://www.amazon.com/African-MiGs-Madagascar-Zimbabwe-Sub-Saharan/dp/0982553986/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482662268&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=african+migs) slightly more interesting (indeed, even the library at Wright Patterson should have a copy of each). Except for discussing acquisitions and operational history of its title, it's also providing - often quite lengthy - summaries of local air forces at wars, so also those since 1990 (just for example, I do not know any other book discussing COIN ops by the Ugandan People's Defence Force/Air Force against Lord's Resistance Army since 2000). 'Bonus', if you like: Volume 2 ends with a big appendix providing a detailed ORBAT of 23 African air forces as of 2010 (with exception of Mozambique and Mali, not much changed ever since).

I agree with your conclusion that African Wars - like II Congo War - are usually discussed from the geo-political POV, very rarely from military POV. Exceptions are rather rare, regardless if it's about pre- or post-1990s, and so also in the case of such wars like that in Rwanda, or the I and II Congo Wars. For example, while there are dozens of books, and thousands of studies and articles about Rwanda, all I know - without a single exception - are dealing with the genocide of 1994. Until recently (see below) there was not one about military history of the Rwandan Civil War, 1990-1994. Similarly, books like those by Prunier are 'well known', while those discussing military campaigns appear 'non-existing'. 

Now, instead of explaining whys and hows, let me come to the point, i.e. offer you a few reading tips. Since you've explicitly requested '**post 1990 Africa**', in your place I would start with John W Turner's [Continent Ablaze](https://www.amazon.com/Continent-Ablaze-Insurgency-Africa-Present/dp/185409128X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482660101&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=continent+ablaze+turner).

- [Wars and Insurgencies of Uganda, 1971-1994](https://www.amazon.com/Wars-Insurgencies-Uganda-1971-1994-Africa/dp/1910294551/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482661297&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=wars+and+insurgencies+of+uganda) (story of the Ugandan military build-up through 1960s and 1970s; the Kagera War of 1978-1979, and of various insurgencies of the 1980s and 1990s, some of which in turn were instrumental for the following volume)

- [The Rwandan Patriotic Front, 1990-1994](https://www.amazon.com/Rwandan-Patriotic-Front-1990-1994-Africa/dp/191029456X/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=BH7SPCDRTHZS5771D2V8) (wars in Ugandas proved crucial for what happened in Rwanda of the early 1990s; namely, already Museveni's NRA was heavily dependent on hundreds of Rwandan Tutsis, who in turn created the Rwandan Patriotic Front and invaded Rwanda in 1990, launching a civil war that... well, is de-facto still going on, 'but', kind of 'culminated' with the genocide of 1994)

- [Great Lakes Holocaust: I Congo War, 1996-1997](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Lakes-Holocaust-1996-1997-Africa/dp/1909384658/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482661505&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=great+lakes+holocaust) (in 1996, Rwanda, followed by Uganda, launched an invasion of the then Zaire, eventually toppling US/French-supported dictator Mobutu Sese-Seko; this is the story of that conflict), and 

- [Great Lakes Conflagration: II Congo War, 1998-2003](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Lakes-Conflagration-Second-1998-2003/dp/1909384666/ref=pd_sim_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=BNV4E03AGSKX0B5XCQ2W) (in 1998, Rwanda and Uganda launched their second invasion of the DR Congo, this time attempting not only to topple President Kabila, but also establish themselves in control over immense mineral wealth in the east of that country; this in turn prompted a counter-intervention by Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia - and even Libyan-sponsored Chad, plus few other countries; what is next-to-unknown is that this war kind of 'faded away' not only because of highly-published  series of major clashes between Ugandans and Rwandans related to distribution of the loot, but especially because the Congolese began applying the same strategy upon Rwandans, which Rwandans used to apply on the Congolese, early during that war). 

I did originally intend to follow-up with a third volume on the DR Congo since 2003, but sad point is: as much as they are praised by all of their readers, the latter remain very limited in numbers. My understanding of the reasons is that these books are neither sensationalist, nor discussing usual topics like mass suffering of civilians, but rather dry military histories of conflicts in question. And since majority of potential readers cannot imagine - just for example - Zimbabweans deploying their adaptation of Rhodesian 'Fire Force tactics' in the centre of the DR Congo of 1998, they never come to the idea that there are any kind of books discussing such topics. Unsurprisingly, I doubt we've sold more than 500 copies of any of these titles, which in turn means they simply do not pay. For similar reasons, I dropped the idea of preparing similar volumes on topics like Sudan or Chad, just for example. Slightly more successful was the [Libyan Air Wars](https://www.amazon.com/Libyan-Air-Wars-Part-1986-1989/dp/1910294543/ref=pd_sim_14_3?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=2MZV4SZV1MNB7J2XQ1JH) mini-series (3 titles); that might eventually 'provoke' me to ready a title (or two) on 'Libya since 2011' (there're certainly enough sources and info, especially thanks to research by Arnaud Delalande). We'll see... 

Fans of obscure (indeed: often enough 'weird') air forces and their (frequently: 'colourful') aircraft have found the two-part study [African MiGs](https://www.amazon.com/African-MiGs-Madagascar-Zimbabwe-Sub-Saharan/dp/0982553986/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482662268&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=african+migs) slightly more interesting (indeed, even the library at Wright Patterson should have a copy of each). Except for discussing acquisitions and operational history of its title, it's also providing - often quite lengthy - summaries of local air forces at wars, so also those since 1990 (just for example, I do not know any other book discussing COIN ops by the Ugandan People's Defence Force/Air Force against Lord's Resistance Army since 2000). 'Bonus', if you like: Volume 2 ends with a big appendix providing a detailed ORBAT of 23 African air forces as of 2010 (with exception of Mozambique and Mali, not much changed ever since).

I have bought good rough on Ebay, but I've also been shafted. I do not recommend Ebay. There are a few good shops online, like TMSgems.com that sell quality rough. I usually pick up my rough at gem/rock shows. I bring along a gem light and a hand loupe to check the rough. You can also buy some Refractol, it's a liquid that has a high RI that will make the stone translucent and you can see any internal inclusions.

Part 3: 1986–1989 (Africa @ War Series),"Few months ago, there was a similar question at War College, though related to Uganda, see thread [How does the Ugandan Army compare to its neighbors?](https://www.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/55oyxm/how_does_the_ugandan_army_compare_to_its_neighbors/?)

I agree with your conclusion that African Wars - like II Congo War - are usually discussed from the geo-political POV, very rarely from military POV. Exceptions are rather rare, regardless if it's about pre- or post-1990s, and so also in the case of such wars like that in Rwanda, or the I and II Congo Wars. For example, while there are dozens of books, and thousands of studies and articles about Rwanda, all I know - without a single exception - are dealing with the genocide of 1994. Until recently (see below) there was not one about military history of the Rwandan Civil War, 1990-1994. Similarly, books like those by Prunier are 'well known', while those discussing military campaigns appear 'non-existing'. 

Now, instead of explaining whys and hows, let me come to the point, i.e. offer you a few reading tips. Since you've explicitly requested '**post 1990 Africa**', in your place I would start with John W Turner's [Continent Ablaze](https://www.amazon.com/Continent-Ablaze-Insurgency-Africa-Present/dp/185409128X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482660101&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=continent+ablaze+turner). Yes, about 95% of that book is about pre-1990s, i.e. 'classic African wars', and post-1990s chapters are limited to those about Angola, actually. Furthermore, a lot of Turner's work is based on little else but reporting by BBC's Foreign Monitoring Service and similar 'sources'. But, you'll learn a lot about most of reasons for post-1990s wars. Plus, it's one of less than a handful of books covering African wars one can find in libraries of such places like Sandhurst, so I would describe it as a 'good starter'. If nothing else, it's going to help you find out what wars do you want to follow closely. 

Casual search around the internet might bring you to various books by Al J Venter, a veteran South African author of works like [War Dog](https://www.amazon.com/War-Dog-Fighting-Peoples-Mercenary/dp/1932033904/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482660429&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=al+venter), [Gunship Ace](https://www.amazon.com/Gunship-Ace-Neall-Helicopter-Mercenary/dp/1612000703/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482660429&amp;sr=8-12&amp;keywords=al+venter), or [Barrel of a Gun](https://www.amazon.com/Barrel-Gun-Correspondents-Misspent-Moments/dp/1935149253/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482660429&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=al+venter). These are including a great deal of 'episodes' related to South African mercenaries in places like Congo, Sierra Leone, Angola etc. Al was in all of these places, and is personally befriended to most of crucial actors, and thus simply 'unbeatable' in regards of 'details'. What one might miss in his books though, would be for these stories to be put within their geopolitical and military context, i.e. a slightly better organization of all the data they're presenting. But then, that's simply a matter of taste. 

Still, if you follow 'Al's trail', you might stumble into a small South African publisher titled [30 Degrees South](http://www.30degreessouth.co.za/) - and thus find out this has published a number of titles penned by Eeben Barlow. 

Clearly, while Barlow is well-known (or at least 'Executive Outcomes' is going to ring plenty of bells here, so I'm sure), his top military planners and tacticians like Roelf van Heerden and Andrew Hudson remain entirely unknown in the public - although at least the latter has published a number of his own titles, mostly via 30 Deg South (just check their website). 

Further search for the latter might bring you to a series of books published in cooperation between 30 Deg South and [Helion Publishing](http://www.helion.co.uk/) (UK) since some 6-7 years and appropriately titled '[Africa@War](http://www.30degreessouth.co.za/africa_war.htm)'. They've released about 25 titles so far. Of course, majority of these went into 'classic' topics from the 1960s-1980s - i.e. those related to South Africa, Rhodesia, Portuguese campaigns in the Guine, Angola, or mercenaries in the Congo etc. But, meanwhile they've brought out quite a number of titles about 'other' African wars out, and especially those about conflicts since 1990s - including such like [Somalia, US Intervention, 1992-1994](https://www.amazon.com/Somalia-Intervention-1992-1994-Africa-War/dp/1909384615/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482661860&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=somalia+africa%40war), or the much postponed [AMISOM](https://www.amazon.com/AMISOM-Battle-Somalia-2006-2013-Africa/dp/1909384674/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482661773&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=amisom+africa%40war). 

Guess, this is the point at which I must beg admins for some more of their understanding (perhaps even some 'sympathy'), then because of my own involvement the following is going to appear as another post full of 'shameless self-advertising'. Namely, I do happen to have researched quite a lot about modern-day African wars (often with help from kind people like Andrew, Al and many others) and so I have joined the gang of Africa@War and published several titles in that series, often in cooperation with my Swiss friend Adrien Fontanelaz.

* That chunky heels are an option 

* Actually warm/practical winter clothing (thank you LL Bean)

* High-top sneakers actually keep you surprisingly warmer -- ankles are important!

* 1 super nice pair of work-appropriate shoes &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 10 pairs of cheap shoes that match perfectly

&gt; A functionally useful approximation of an isochrone from a single origin point via bipedal locomotion in a city with a primarily rectilinear arrangement of interspersed paths of conveyance between impassible erections can be constructed on a representation of a specific area without accounting for the specific local features of that area by taking the average walking speed of a human, multiplying it by the desired increment of time, then marking a point that distance from the origin in each of four directions parallel to the overall rectilinear orientation of the paths of conveyance, then connecting the points to form a quadrilateral with its diagonals parallel to the overall layout of paths of conveyance, sides of equal length, and corners meeting at right angles; this resulting shape also would meet the qualifications of, in increasing order of specificity, a parallelogram, a rhombus, and a square.
&gt;
&gt;This approximation is most useful if the representation it is generated on is to scale and is as close to a flat 2-brane as is practical to construct, despite the underlying topology of the area varying due to being a combination of the result of a complex set of geological events occurring on an object with an approximately oblate ovoid shape which have further been modified by construction activities. In this particular area, the vertical variances are negligible in regards to the applicability of the approximation, as the constructed impediments to motion causing largely non-linear paths results in a significant distortion in the distance of travel required, while inclinations and declinations are unlikely to affect travel speed more than already has to be accounted for by variances in walking speed of individuals when compared to the average used for the approximation. Placement of the origin point is ideally located adjacent to one of the paths of conveyance, as placement elsewhere is likely to result in increased travel time to a path of conveyance not accounted for in the approximation.
&gt;
&gt;A square of this orientation, where the sides are at an angle of 8/τ radians to the overall orientation of what would locally considered on the representation to be horizontal and vertical (although the orientation in the area represented would result in the sides of the square following bearings of approximately 55, 145, 235, and, 325) is often referred to as a diamond, as is the case for road signs^1, chemical hazard warning signs^2, and rankings of ski slope difficulty^3.
&gt;
&gt;In some contexts, an equilateral quadrilateral, or rhombus, is referred to as a diamond as well, and is commonly used as an indicator of suit on bridge or poker style playing cards^4 and is also used for rankings of ski slope difficulty, particularly when multiple copies are needed on the same sign^5. The term polyiamond was even back-formed to refer to a shape that can be formed by aligning the sides of an equilateral triangle in an 2 dimensional plane, a specific case of which is the shape formed by two equilateral triangles and results in the name diamond using the naming convention employed for this class of shape^6. However in this case, its use would only be appropriate if there was an abnormal but regular reduction or increase of average speed in line with only one set of parallel paths of conveyance and not the other. Such a phenomenon would be highly unlikely in Alexandria, Virginia.
&gt;
&gt;Such phenomena being unusual in general, it was assumed that the preference for the square form of a diamond was implied, and I apologize for making any assumptions of any kind (even though they are generally necessary in daily life to avoid becoming mentally unstable due to excessive solipsism, which is why I don’t stop making them, and sometimes find myself apologizing for even reasonable ones).

&gt;A square of this orientation, where the sides are at an angle of 8/τ radians to the overall orientation of what would locally considered on the representation to be horizontal and vertical (although the orientation in the area represented would result in the sides of the square following bearings of approximately 55, 145, 235, and, 325) is often referred to as a diamond, as is the case for road signs^1, chemical hazard warning signs^2, and rankings of ski slope difficulty^3.
&gt;
&gt;In some contexts, an equilateral quadrilateral, or rhombus, is referred to as a diamond as well, and is commonly used as an indicator of suit on bridge or poker style playing cards^4 and is also used for rankings of ski slope difficulty, particularly when multiple copies are needed on the same sign^5. The term polyiamond was even back-formed to refer to a shape that can be formed by aligning the sides of an equilateral triangle in an 2 dimensional plane, a specific case of which is the shape formed by two equilateral triangles and results in the name diamond using the naming convention employed for this class of shape^6. However in this case, its use would only be appropriate if there was an abnormal but regular reduction or increase of average speed in line with only one set of parallel paths of conveyance and not the other. Such a phenomenon would be highly unlikely in Alexandria, Virginia.
&gt;
&gt;Such phenomena being unusual in general, it was assumed that the preference for the square form of a diamond was implied, and I apologize for making any assumptions of any kind (even though they are generally necessary in daily life to avoid becoming mentally unstable due to excessive solipsism, which is why I don’t stop making them, and sometimes find myself apologizing for even reasonable ones).

I thought it would be fairly evident from context that I was not referring to crystalline carbon or a 2 dimensional graphical representation of a cut used for crystalline carbon.

However, if I were to formulate a response similar to the following for every comment I made on Reddit, I wouldn’t actually be able to read nearly as much on Reddit:

&gt; A functionally useful approximation of an isochrone from a single origin point via bipedal locomotion in a city with a primarily rectilinear arrangement of interspersed paths of conveyance between impassible erections can be constructed on a representation of a specific area without accounting for the specific local features of that area by taking the average walking speed of a human, multiplying it by the desired increment of time, then marking a point that distance from the origin in each of four directions parallel to the overall rectilinear orientation of the paths of conveyance, then connecting the points to form a quadrilateral with its diagonals parallel to the overall layout of paths of conveyance, sides of equal length, and corners meeting at right angles; this resulting shape also would meet the qualifications of, in increasing order of specificity, a parallelogram, a rhombus, and a square.
&gt;
&gt;This approximation is most useful if the representation it is generated on is to scale and is as close to a flat 2-brane as is practical to construct, despite the underlying topology of the area varying due to being a combination of the result of a complex set of geological events occurring on an object with an approximately oblate ovoid shape which have further been modified by construction activities. In this particular area, the vertical variances are negligible in regards to the applicability of the approximation, as the constructed impediments to motion causing largely non-linear paths results in a significant distortion in the distance of travel required, while inclinations and declinations are unlikely to affect travel speed more than already has to be accounted for by variances in walking speed of individuals when compared to the average used for the approximation. Placement of the origin point is ideally located adjacent to one of the paths of conveyance, as placement elsewhere is likely to result in increased travel time to a path of conveyance not accounted for in the approximation.
&gt;
&gt;A square of this orientation, where the sides are at an angle of 8/τ radians to the overall orientation of what would locally considered on the representation to be horizontal and vertical (although the orientation in the area represented would result in the sides of the square following bearings of approximately 55, 145, 235, and, 325) is often referred to as a diamond, as is the case for road signs^1, chemical hazard warning signs^2, and rankings of ski slope difficulty^3.

Yes the cost is double, but then you need to consider the routing time to create the extra holes for all the buttons, assembly time, and possibly other variables. At that point, cost could be closer to each other. But ultimately, an analog stick makes more sense then ""button modifiers"", which is more at risk of being banned compared to an analog stick.

The title is *He Talk Like A White Boy*. https://www.amazon.com/He-Talk-Like-White-Boy/dp/0762423994

In college I had a few classes with a black immigrant from Congo (don't recall if it was Democratic Republic of the Congo, or the much smaller Republic of the Congo). He was very soft-spoken and articulate, and spoke *fourteen languages*. English with near-fluency, IIRC he also French, Portuguese and a number of native African languages. He mentioned once in a discussion that white Americans never once gave him any grief about his accent or when he occasionally made a grammar or vocabulary mistake. But black people routinely teased him about ""talking funny"" or when he misspoke and mimicked him jokingly. 

he also told me about a SJW incident with a white female professor. he described himself as ""black African"" or ""black Congolese"" once, and the prof interrupted him to say that ""African American"" was the preferred term. he said he had no objection to being described as black, and was not yet a US citizen so didn't feel right calling himself American. case closed, right? nope. the teacher lorded her privilege all over him and said that whatever he preferred, African-American was the proper description. 

edit: the (black) economist Thomas Sowell also write an interesting book called *Black Rednecks and White Liberals*. He examines how 'ghetto' culture can actually be traced back to rowdy white rednecks who immigrated to the US from Scotland IIRC. ghetto is not authentic black or African in any way.

Keyboard: 
https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Keyboard-Ultra-Thin-Wireless-Rotating/dp/B01B6CEUSI

Fit:
The fit is extremely snug. The SP3 is pretty well secured, and I'm not worried about it falling out. The bottom hinges have some sort of rubber or foam-type material to create the grip. I do worry if there is too much pressure on the bottom corners, as this was made for an iPad Pro that is slightly thinner. Only time will tell! Note: the kickstand must be opened up in order for it to fit.

Build quality:
The hinges are creaky and noisy when lifting the tablet up. I'm not sure if this is the case using it with an iPad Pro, as I haven't gotten around to testing it on mine. The keyboard itself feels mostly study, but a little cheap. The keyboard sells on Amazon for $30-35, so it's not exactly a surprise. There is a little bit of flex to the keyboard, but no more than you might expect. The keyboard feels about the size of my 13in MBP from work. Overall it's fairly comfortable, and it just goes to prove that I ultimately want a Surface Book! Having a more traditional laptop setup is much more useful than balancing the SP3 on my laptop with the type cover. 

Keyboard/Typing:
Overall it feels pretty good. The keyboard is pretty responsive. Getting it to recognize on boot takes two presses of the on-keyboard power button and a few seconds of waiting. Keyboard travel is fine, but I'm not someone who gets hung up on keyboard quality. It is at least as good as my SP3 type cover, if not better because of the solid, flat form. Some of the dedicated top row keys don't really work, as they are made for iOS. The volume keys work correctly, though. Unfortunately, since iOS doesn't need an escape key, the key in it's location just opens a blank page in Edge. This makes it particularly tricky due to habits when playing games like WoW or FFXIV on my Surface. The command key does work as a Windows key, though. 

Misc Thoughts: 
Not having a trackpad is a huge hurdle to overcome. My Surface now feels like a laptop, but I keep moving to try and use a trackpad. I won't count it as a negative, obviously, because this was intended for iPads. You absolutely have to use this thing with a mouse, as you can see my Arc Touch mouse. 

It might seem obvious, but it is pretty top heavy with the Surface attached. It's not so bad that I feel like it is going to fall over. But if I take my hands off the keyboard on my lap, it does lean back slightly. 

Closing thoughts: 
It really doesn't make sense that someone hasn't made a product like this for the Surface tablets. If this had a traditional Windows keyboard with hinges made precisely for this device, I feel like it would be an instant buy for most Surface owners. Maybe it would drive people away from buying the Surface Book, so I could see Microsoft not encouraging such an accessory. 

Overall, I like it. I will let you all know after using it for a month or so if I still am using it. Not a bad present from my wife, although I wouldn't have said no to a Surface Book!

CNN employed Corey Lewandowski and MSNBC employed Joe Scarborough while both were actively involved in advising Donald Trump's campaign, for example.   Roger Ailes and other senior-level FNC staff are also partisan Republicans who have been active in politics.  You can write lists forever.

I think there are two important distinctions to make:  the ""news room"" coverage of each type of agency, where objectivity and investigative journalism are valued, and the editorializing type content.  The news rooms of all major media companies are generally either center-left or completely non-partisan (even Fox News).  The point where they differ is in the editorial content, morning shows, talking head babbling and all that.   The Fox News website is also very, very, very, very low on journalistic standards and objectively-evaluated content.

The point I was making, if allowed to expand a little bit on the subject, is that it is relatively very rare to find unmoderated representation of Democrats or liberals on Fox News, while Republicans are often given both talking-head representation but also editorial control on several forums at CNN and MSNBC.  Fox News also has a coherent policy of taking management-defined talking points that come from the exec-level strategy (all Republican partisans) which is then propagated across its different channels, differing shows, and website.  This comes from upper management and often has an explicit partisan objective.  This is not an academic-level source, but I recommend [this](https://www.amazon.com/Loudest-Voice-Room-Brilliant-News/dp/0812992857/) book if you're interested in learning more about how Fox News functioned under Ailes.  I will grant that the slant of both CNN and MSNBC editorials tends to the left, but they do not function as partisan organs the same way Fox does.

MSNBC and CNN have a center or center-left editorial perspective, but in generally they cover Republicans more favorably than Fox covers Democrats as partisanship is concerned.  You don't have to trust my opinion.  There are plenty of objective studies that show Fox has a more partisan slant in its day-to-day coverage than the other two major cable networks and that even CNN and MSNBC have coverage tendencies that often support Republicans as well as democrats.  There are also lots of studies that supposed ""left-wing"" or ""right-wing"" news rooms are actually quite centrist.  

[Here](https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc3935/m2/1/high_res_d/thesis.pdf) is an interesting one relating an objective study of agenda-setting and television coverage during the 04 campaign.   [This](http://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2016/10/06/study-compared-msnbc-and-cnn-fox-news-devotes-more-time-trump-events-and-less-time-clinton-events/213578) shows the discrepancy in coverage of Trump/Clinton campaign rallies between the three over the summer. [This](http://mediamatters.org/blog/2016/09/13/study-cable-news-devotes-13-times-much-coverage-clinton-health-trump-foundation/213041) is an interesting one, shows the disparity among coverage around two specific issues (Hillary's pneumonia and Trump's improper use of Trump Organization funds) that broke at the same time.  [This](http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/Media-Bias-Is-Real-Finds-UCLA-6664) study, also from 2004, shows a breakdown of the sources and methods each media company uses which gives an interesting and often-unexpected result.  

I'm not trying to beat a partisan drum.  I do vote liberal, but I really don't care for any of the three networks.  Can you honestly say you've taken the time to look at this issue objectively?",11,,JohnHenryAaron,,,2016,12,2016-12-28T20:14:09,t5_2cneq,0,politics,http://reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5kqpum/c/dbq7xxv,491d32c30c4b8608cca0b033a4523c0c9f56a57e01efedf1af98c9da83379ec4

This dashcam will serve you well as far as reliability, video quality and dependability, however, you must be aware that there are limitations with any dashcam as to what they can see, since they are in a fixed position in your car.

The next thing you have to consider is how you are going to 'power it up' for a couple of days at a time, it certainly cannot run off your car battery for that long.  There are several battery packs that are available but they must be hardwired to your fuse panel, and even then, they depend on you running the car for a period of time.  Are you saying that your car is going to sit in the parking lot without moving for a couple of days?

If you don't want to hardwire the dashcam you could use a palm-sized portable power bank which should be good for a couple of days before needing to be recharged.

I spent 12 dollars on one and it is the best money I ever spent.  I'd say only 60 percent of players have one.  Super duper convenient.

A gun stand

http://www.ansgear.com/Splattrak_Paintball_Gun_Stand_Graphite_p/splattrackgunstandblack.htm

I got a different one (guru paintball gun stand, disassembles to be super small in a gear bag).  I spent 20 dollars on mine although I linked to a more expensive/fancier one.  Best money I ever spent.  I'd say only about 1/3 of players have one.  


A pod swab.  It's used for cleaning out a pod when you bust a ball ont he field, or for drying them after you're done cleaning them at home.

http://www.ansgear.com/Exalt_Pod_Swab_Green_p/exaltpodswabgreen.htm

17 dollars, and it's the best money I've ever spent.  I'd say only 5 percent of players have one.

A paintball chronograph.

http://www.ansgear.com/Paintball_Chronograph_s/200.htm

I have the yellow one, spent 50 dollars on it used, although you can find them for 35-40 these days and it was the best money I've ever spent.  Get one used, doesn't hve to be the Sports Sensor one as that's like the oldest one around.  I'd say 2% of players have a chronograph of their own.

A paintball tech mat.

http://www.ansgear.com/Paintball_Gun_Mat_Tech_Mat_s/1061.htm

It keeps you from losing screws and keeps stuff from scratching or getting scratched.  Spend 15-20 dollars, and it was the best money I ever spent.  I'd say 10 percent of players have one.

Buy him a bunch of pods.  Everyone needs pods.  Get some fancy ones.  The virtue ones are great.

https://www.amazon.com/Virtue-PF135-PF165-Locking-Paintball/dp/B00TSWT04I

Get the longer ones.  They're like 6-7 dollars a piece and they're the best money I ever spent.  They're much better than dye locklids, and I'm really happy with them.  I'd say only 30% of players have fancy pods.


You can never have too many hex keys.  Try to get him a set of extra long ones.  Those balls really aren't necessary, or even good.  The ball-end ones are more likely to strip a screw.  Even if he just bought himself 2 sets of hexkeys, he'd still be happy to have another set.  

Someone else said a goggle case.  That's another expensive item that people usually don't buy for themselves.


It's really hard for a player to spend money on these sorts of things, because there are so man other things they can get.

One of the best I think is the **Blackvue DR 3500 FHD** dashcam.  This is a tubular shaped, all black dashcam that makes for a very stealth installation so that there is little danger of it being noticed and perhaps stolen.  This dashcam is recommended by the North American distributor of Blackvue and other quality dashcams as the very best for its motion detection function, and it is affordable.

The dashcam records in high definition 1080P resolution and will take an extended video storage card up to 126GB which means that it will hold over 40hrs of video before starting to loop and record over itself.

This dashcam will serve you well as far as reliability, video quality and dependability, however, you must be aware that there are limitations with any dashcam as to what they can see, since they are in a fixed position in your car.

The next thing you have to consider is how you are going to 'power it up' for a couple of days at a time, it certainly cannot run off your car battery for that long.  There are several battery packs that are available but they must be hardwired to your fuse panel, and even then, they depend on you running the car for a period of time.  Are you saying that your car is going to sit in the parking lot without moving for a couple of days?

If you don't want to hardwire the dashcam you could use a palm-sized portable power bank which should be good for a couple of days before needing to be recharged.

Here are some links to battery packs, power banks and hardwire kits.

It seems like he also had a power point deck that explained some of this... as do his book on the subject.


What it really comes down to is this. The early church was divided into three leadership branches. The twelve apostles were one of those three branches. But the twelve were the group that was responsible for missionary work. Since missionary work was the life-blood of the new church, and since BY had his face all over this group, it was easy for new converts (who knew BY and the twelve) to follow the Brighamite branch West.

Basically I needed to do the same thing but also re-copy a program we used for user's data migration.

I basically bought a [7 port USB hub](https://www.amazon.com/Plugable-port-USB-3-0-hub/dp/B008ZGKWQI/ref=pd_cp_147_1/163-5106200-4649965?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B008ZGKWQI&amp;pd_rd_r=TNVFEB9QE1W99EX81HYD&amp;pd_rd_w=Zh8CL&amp;pd_rd_wg=OeOzh&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=TNVFEB9QE1W99EX81HYD) and wrote a quick and dirty PowerShell script that wiped them clean, and copied the migration tool files from a static location.  I'll post the code below, but it is far from clean as it was one of the first things in PowerShell I ever wrote (don't judge me):

    $drive = @(""D:"",""E:"",""F:"",""G:"",""H:"",""I:"",""J:"")

&gt; Da esperto di sicurezza, hai qualche consiglio su qualche ""giochino"" da far vedere in conferenze e relazioni per sensibilizzare le persone sull'argomento? Attualmente noto che fa molta presa questo iter (che è più sensazionalistico che altro):
&gt; creo una rete wifi aperta senza dir loro nulla e aprendo wireshark
&gt; durante la conferenza loro ovviamente la utilizzano senza pensarci troppo
&gt; a fine conferenza mostro loro quante cose avrei potuto prelevare se solo avessi voluto

Ehm.. sarà anche sensazionalistico, ma lo faccio spesso anche io, con anche la parte di MITM sui certificati in automatico.

The effect of Bush's illusion hologram on such victims is binding and strong.
De la Madrid claimed to have Mayan/alien ancestry in his blood, whereby he transformed ""back into an Iguana at will."" De la Madrid produced a hologram similar to the one Bush did.
His hologram of lizard-like tongue and eyes produced the illusion that he was transforming into an Iguana.

I kept thinking how alot of that scene is exactly how I envisioned the battle of Cannae in my head (only with Roman soldiers instead of Wildlings and Crows).  I read a really good book a few years back called ""Carnage and Culture"" by Victor Davis Hanson which has an entire chapter dedicated to Cannae. The book very vividly describes how the Romans were encircled and then slowly were forced back as the circle drew tighter and tighter around them like a slowly tightening noose.

I am a history major. If I could time travel, there are two places in history I would definitely NOT want to wind up: The Somme (Either Side), and Cannae (as a Roman soldier).

The higher-end ones tend to be what's called a H.O.T.A.S (Hands On Throttle And Stick). essentially this is a packaged deal with a joystick and throttle quadrant, and is useful for not having to take your eyes (or hands) off the throttle and stick while flying. Some of these can be expensive like the [Thrustmaster Warthog](https://www.amazon.com/ThrustMaster-2960720-Thrustmaster-Warthog-Joystick/dp/B00371R8P4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1481730904&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=thrustmaster+warthog), considered the high end of the sticks. The issue with this as well, is it's modeled off a A-10 Warthog's inputs, so you'll also need to get rudder pedals as well since there is no Z-axis twist on the stick.
For more budget options, I have heard really great things about the [T-16000 M](https://www.amazon.com/Thrustmaster-T-16000M-FCS-HOTAS-Controller/dp/B01KCHPRXA/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1481730904&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=thrustmaster+warthog). You can also buy the stick and throttle separately if you dont have the cash for both right now.

Another company is VKB, a Russian company but uses magnetic ""MARS"" sensors. I actually use their Black Mamba and love it, however the item has since been discontinued and the company itself is hard to get hold of. They currently have affordable sticks modeled on the German KG12 - flight stick used in BF109's and FW 190's (although no throttle quadrant with it). Available on Amazon its called [Gladiator](https://www.amazon.com/Gladiator-Joystick-Flight-Simulator-Controller-Stick/dp/B01G6GT49O/ref=pd_sim_147_8?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B01G6GT49O&amp;pd_rd_r=AJGEB09FZF0PD68WFTX4&amp;pd_rd_w=O1lWs&amp;pd_rd_wg=63eYz&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=AJGEB09FZF0PD68WFTX4)

Saitek makes several sticks, however they're in a transitioning period. They were just bought-out by Logitech and some people have complained about quality issues with their newer sticks and lack of customer support, so I'd only recommend them if you can get a great deal on a stick on sale, or possibly a used one for cheap. Their models are the X52 Pro, X-55, and X-65. I had the 52 Pro and never had any issues, but its one of those buy beware moments with them right now.

And then there's really affordable sticks that work fine too, such as the [logitech extreme 3d pro](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-963290-0403-Extreme-Joystick-Windows/dp/B00009OY9U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1481731650&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=logitech+extreme+3d+pro) and [Thrustmaster T-Flight X](https://www.amazon.com/Thrustmaster-T-Flight-Hotas-X-Flight-Stick/dp/B001CXYMFS/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1481731650&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=logitech+extreme+3d+pro). These are reliable sticks that lack some of the fancy things like buttons and dials for radiator management for example. I know guys who fly using these and love it.

Another thing that is highly recommended to get, but is not required to play the game, is called a [Track IR](https://www.amazon.com/TrackIr-5-Premium-Head-Tracking-Gaming/dp/B0029M6VKA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1481731857&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=trackir). If you watch in my video, I'm swiveling my head back and forth to check my 6, and make sure theres no enemy aircraft diving on us. I'm not using the mouse, or any input to look around, rather I have a clip on my headset that uses IR sensors to turn my head in game without having to take my hands off the HOTAS. [Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTxo2XuXhaw) of how it works. Again, not necessary to buy, but one of those things to hope to get down the road. There are free alternatives called Freetrack which uses a webcam, I think. I havent messed with that but I know a few guys who do use it and are happy with it.

The issue with this as well, is it's modeled off a A-10 Warthog's inputs, so you'll also need to get rudder pedals as well since there is no Z-axis twist on the stick.
For more budget options, I have heard really great things about the [T-16000 M](https://www.amazon.com/Thrustmaster-T-16000M-FCS-HOTAS-Controller/dp/B01KCHPRXA/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1481730904&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=thrustmaster+warthog). You can also buy the stick and throttle separately if you dont have the cash for both right now.

Another company is VKB, a Russian company but uses magnetic ""MARS"" sensors. I actually use their Black Mamba and love it, however the item has since been discontinued and the company itself is hard to get hold of. They currently have affordable sticks modeled on the German KG12 - flight stick used in BF109's and FW 190's (although no throttle quadrant with it). Available on Amazon its called [Gladiator](https://www.amazon.com/Gladiator-Joystick-Flight-Simulator-Controller-Stick/dp/B01G6GT49O/ref=pd_sim_147_8?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B01G6GT49O&amp;pd_rd_r=AJGEB09FZF0PD68WFTX4&amp;pd_rd_w=O1lWs&amp;pd_rd_wg=63eYz&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=AJGEB09FZF0PD68WFTX4)

Saitek makes several sticks, however they're in a transitioning period. They were just bought-out by Logitech and some people have complained about quality issues with their newer sticks and lack of customer support, so I'd only recommend them if you can get a great deal on a stick on sale, or possibly a used one for cheap. Their models are the X52 Pro, X-55, and X-65. I had the 52 Pro and never had any issues, but its one of those buy beware moments with them right now.

And then there's really affordable sticks that work fine too, such as the [logitech extreme 3d pro](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-963290-0403-Extreme-Joystick-Windows/dp/B00009OY9U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1481731650&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=logitech+extreme+3d+pro) and [Thrustmaster T-Flight X](https://www.amazon.com/Thrustmaster-T-Flight-Hotas-X-Flight-Stick/dp/B001CXYMFS/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1481731650&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=logitech+extreme+3d+pro). These are reliable sticks that lack some of the fancy things like buttons and dials for radiator management for example. I know guys who fly using these and love it.

Another thing that is highly recommended to get, but is not required to play the game, is called a [Track IR](https://www.amazon.com/TrackIr-5-Premium-Head-Tracking-Gaming/dp/B0029M6VKA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1481731857&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=trackir). If you watch in my video, I'm swiveling my head back and forth to check my 6, and make sure theres no enemy aircraft diving on us. I'm not using the mouse, or any input to look around, rather I have a clip on my headset that uses IR sensors to turn my head in game without having to take my hands off the HOTAS. [Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTxo2XuXhaw) of how it works. Again, not necessary to buy, but one of those things to hope to get down the road. There are free alternatives called Freetrack which uses a webcam, I think. I havent messed with that but I know a few guys who do use it and are happy with it.

I think thats a fairly decent summary. Feel free to PM with any questions, or check out our group's forums if you'd like to do some more research

This is actually pretty crucial since otherwise the cubes could fall out into the lid of the case between sessions.

The intention is that you would on a long rest, place cubes into the spell slots that you have available.  Then every time you cast a spell slot, remove the cube and put it into the larger hole underneath.

My uncle on my mom's side used to have access to discounted tickets to Dorney Park, and every year we'd get my mom's side of the family together to spend a day there. Usually the day would go off without a hitch - to wit, none of the rides were ever inactive, and only one of eight or so annual visits were rained out. 

One year, however, our Dorney trip coincided with a heat wave. In an effort to ensure the success of the trip, my parents spent the preceding days trying to figure out how we were going to stay hydrated. My dad assumed that the park would provide complimentary water just to minimize the risk of heatstroke or dehydration or whatever among the patrons and rested on that assumption. My mother, not wanting to make any assumptions, decided to bring a backup plan in the form of a rather large water storage bag [similar to the one listed here](http://www.amazon.com/Boli-Litres-Collapsible-Container-Carrier-/dp/B00L8JDLIA/ref=lp_9750705011_1_6?srs=9750705011&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1460571999&amp;sr=8-6). How she expected us to access it is anyone's guess - were we supposed to find plastic cups somewhere, or just drink from the spout? - but despite (or because of?) my dad's derisive comments to her plan, mother held fast, and when Dorney day rolled around she carried in her handbag a massive plastic bladder of lukewarm water.

The weather that day turned out to be, as expected, hot. Not quite hot enough to be considered ""oppressive"", but still enough to have people diving for shade. Me being me, I wanted to start the day off with a coaster, but given that I was rather young at the time, the most logical option was the Wild Mouse. My sister followed, and only our parents accompanied us; the rest of the party had booked it to Wildwater Kingdom. 

Perhaps this has changed since the early 2000s, but as a result of the park's family-friendliness, the ride's family-friendliness, and the ride's location close to the gate and along the main midway, Dorney's Wild Mouse tends to be unusually popular for what it is. Despite the heat, this time was no exception, and the three of us spent around ten or fifteen minutes in the (at that time) uncovered queue line, baking in the sun. When we got to the station, we handed our hats to our mother for safekeeping, Dad and I yielded the front seat to the ladies, and away we went toward disaster.

Now, before we entered the queue, my father had indeed found a park employee handing out free water. (Iced, no less - Cedar Fair takes care of its people!) Not one to admit defeat so easily, my mother had taken her handbag with her in line in case we spent enough time there to grow thirsty or overheated, in which case she could claim that her hydration plan had been validated and lord it over my father. However, thanks to my dad's efforts, the bag-o'-water remained unopened, sticking Mom with a useless piece of baggage. This led to a conondrum when we got to the station: the lack of an obvious safe place for personal items presented an obvious problem for my mother, who wasn't keen on anyone taking her bladder of tepid silliness for themselves. Mom weighed her options and, given that the Wild Mouse was tame enough to not repel the timid young mewtwo15026, decided to bring her handbag onto the ride.

Around the fourth hairpin, the handbag decided to overrule her decision and jettisoned itself into the queue line.

Once we returned to the station, my parents notified an attendant, who immediately retrieved the bag, mostly to put a stop to the tantrum I was throwing due to the loss of my hat. (Cedar Fair takes care of its people.) Sure enough, the multi-gallon missile-o'-water had burst upon landing, rendering itself completely useless and drenching everything else in the handbag. Fortunately, the projectile had stopped short of hitting any fellow patrons; considering the heat, I doubt anyone would have minded if it hadn't.

I hate cast iron. Don't get cast iron. Unless you're collecting everything for a true Japanese Chanoyu set, don't even think about cast iron. In any normal setting they're just a chunk of inconvenient heavy hot metal and most people don't take care of them and then they rust. 

Okay going past that, welcome to tea! :) There's a variety of different kinds of pots and other brewing vessels to start with. It mostly depends on what style you like best. I always recommend that people get small teapots to start with if teapots are the way they want to go. A lot of us also use gaiwans, but since you're just getting started it's fine to first find a pot with which you're comfortable and happy with. I used to have a [Bee House teapot](http://www.beehouseteapot.com/bbn01.htm) like this one that I loved. They're very easy to use, look very nice, come in many of colors, and are easy to clean. I also like these other [Japanese basket style teapots](https://www.amazon.com/Kutani-pottery-teapot-mountain-strainer/dp/B00D3XWOD2/ref=redir_mobile_desktop?ie=UTF8&amp;dpID=51IsJkkjw7L&amp;dpPl=1&amp;keywords=Japanese%20ceramic%20teapot&amp;pi=AC_SX236_SY340_FMwebp_QL65&amp;qid=1480836594&amp;ref=plSrch&amp;ref_=mp_s_a_1_48&amp;sr=8-48) too. Kutani is a famous kiln and produces a wide range of lovely teaware and other ceramics. I saw a bunch more on Amazon by them that looked really nice. 

I would personally also suggest avoiding glass teapots, they really do break very easily or can get scratched etc. If the basket is glass too then it's usually a major pain to clean.

Simply, before you start your controller and let the bluetooth connect, turn the pc's bluetooth settings off so its not searching, make the controller search, then right after that, turn the pc's bluetooth on. It'll connect and sync fine.

Beans and greens should be the cornerstones of a healthy vegan diet. You want to cook lots and lots of legumes (beans, lentils, peas). They're the best vegan source of protein, as well as an excellent source of folate, calcium, and iron. Super important! Also, greens. That's where vegans are going to get most of their calcium (unless they drink a lot of fortified plant milk). You also want to make sure she's getting a tablespoon of either chia or ground flaxseed every day, for adequate intake of Omega-3. I put mine in a green breakfast smoothie to start the day with a kick!

I recommend you watch the documentary ""Forks Over Knives."" It will change the way you think about food. It's on Netflix. They have a [companion cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=Forks+Over+Knives) that's pretty decent.

As you can see, I have a bias for the whole-food plant-based version of veganism. I'm going to assume that as a mother, you want the healthiest diet for your kids. She'll find plenty of delicious vegan junk food when she's out with her friends, so cooking whole foods at home is a great way to set a solid foundation for life. Good for the rest of your family, too!

Some great vegan dishes: beans &amp; rice; bean burritos; chickpea curry (watch the coconut milk, it's high in fat and that's actually a much bigger risk factor for diabetes than carbs); lentil stew (which is awesome when you're short on time, because lentils don't require soaking; of course you can also use canned beans when you're in a hurry); tofu and veggie stir fry. You can also take almost any recipe and veganise it by swapping out the meat for tempeh or tofu, and using extra marinade or sauce. For snacks, raw veggies with hummus, nuts and seeds, raisins, and green smoothies are all really healthy and delicious. I start every day with a breakfast smoothie of kale, mixed fruit and berries, and flaxseed. I use a high powered blender (Vitamix or Blendtec) to break down the tough fibres and cells walls. That helps nutrient absorption as the food is already masticated.

While they're tasty and popular, I try and stay away from the fake meats and cheeses. They're vegan junk food. They might provide some protein, but you're far better getting that from whole plants like beans, chickpeas, and lentils.

As for the pasta-diabetes link, don't worry! A low-fat plant-based diet has been shown to halt and even reverse diabetes in even the most advanced cases. Check out the book ""[Starch Solution](https://www.amazon.com/Starch-Solution-Regain-Health-Weight/dp/1623360277/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483036938&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=starch+solution)"" by Dr. John McDougall.

If things were truly ""neutral"" or ""okay"" they wouldn't be so negative about it. Not only that, but others here have commented on how nonchalant they are about death, etc. You wouldn't be like that *unless* you were exposed to all the terrible things NK defectors are constantly talking about.

I don't know why people think there's some massive anti-NK conspiracy. I'm sure there is plenty of inaccuracies in NK defector accounts (that's just how humans are in general) but there is **no way** that this isn't a similar situation to the Holocaust going on right now in NK.

I really get angry when I watch a lot of these ""tourist"" videos and they're like, ""Things aren't so bad here!"". It's because the NK government is only letting you see the 5% of the country that isn't falling apart.

That's really thoughtful of you! I'll try giving you what items I think both gals/girls would appreciate. 

1. Good, Non-greasy hand lotion. Washing our hands so much dries them out.

2. These sweet pens: http://www.staples.com/BIC-4-Color-Retractable-Ballpoint-Pens-Medium-Point-Blue-Barrel/product_168757?cid=PS:GooglePLAs:168757&amp;ci_src=17588969&amp;ci_sku=168757&amp;KPID=168757&amp;cvosrc=PLA.google-SALES.Office%20Supplies&amp;lsft=cid:PS-_-GooglePLAs-_-168757,kpid:168757,adtype:pla,channel:online&amp;gclid=CKvmp6KO6tACFYK3wAod38oP6A

3. Instant Starbucks coffee packets. 

4. Dayquil/Nightquil combination packets, for when she gets sick and has to power through a shift. Actually- a sort of ""medicine kit"" would be awesome: include ibuprofen, cough drops, tampons, contact solution, tissues- the list goes on. 

5. A sleek ""journal,"" whose sole purpose is to write down meaningful thoughts/moments. In dark times people tend to forget these, so (for me) it's helpful to reflect on them.

6. A copy of ""House of God,"" by Sameul Shem. https://www.amazon.com/House-God-Samuel-Shem/dp/0425238091

7. A Visa Giftcard, to be used on anything she desires.

All the best,

Love coming here for recipes because you know they will be good...I've tried a lot of random recipes found on Pinterest and Google with lots of failures and things that just are not great.

Personal favorites,

Fathead pizza: http://www.ditchthecarbs.com/2015/04/23/fat-head-pizza/


mini cheesecakes (I use cupcake liners) 
2 8oz blocks cream cheese with 3/4 cup xylitol sweetner (link below is the kind I purchase and love....zero after taste but in reality you can use whatever sweetener you like..) https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PT66JYQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1
2 tsp pure vanilla extract (add more if you taste and think it needs it- the batter is delicious ;) )
2 eggs and beat until smooth
Pour into foil cupcake liners
Bake at 350 F for 20 min
Refrigerate until chilled--I like to chop fresh strawberries or raspberries in to the batter to add a ""fruit"" flavor...Rasp are our favorite!

Crockpot Pot Roast
3 lbs pot roast 2 bags baby carrots one sleeve of celery chopped 2 onion chopped 3 beef bouillon cubes dissolve in 1 cup hot water couple garlic cloves chopped. no need to add any additional water. prep time 10 min cook time 8 hrs on low

Also look into Cauliflower mashed (Replacement for mashed potatoes) It is SOOO satisfying..We don't really have a recipe besides cut your cauliflower florets off the head. The less stem the better. Steam for 20 min until VERY tender. Throw into food processor with 3 tbsp butter, 1/4 cup (more if needed) heavy whipping cream, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, and a little cheese (if you'd like) mix until you get the consistency of mashed potatoes. 

Fried wings with garlic parm sauce (You can do garlic, butter, sprinkle with parm cheese)..otherwise I have found low carb mixtures from the store. Medium wing sauce is low carb as well...our favorite is the DRY rub ""Buffalo"" seasoning from Buffalo Wild Wings- SO good and you can buy it on Amazon. 

Deviled eggs (with bacon) Just google a recipe they're simple

Avocados with a sprinkle of salt have become my best friend

These are just a few of our favorites...

&gt;The big economic story of our times is not the Great Recession. It is how China and India began to embrace neoliberal ideas of economics and attributed a sense of dignity and liberty to the bourgeoisie they had denied for so long



[but wait there's more](https://www.amazon.com/Bourgeois-Virtues-Ethics-Age-Commerce/dp/0226556646/ref=pd_bxgy_14_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=0226556646&amp;pd_rd_r=S93WQJK3BY8MG4JAKYJN&amp;pd_rd_w=iloHE&amp;pd_rd_wg=zHysn&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=S93WQJK3BY8MG4JAKYJN)
&gt;For a century and a half, the artists and intellectuals of Europe have scorned the bourgeoisie. And for a millennium and a half, the philosophers and theologians of Europe have scorned the marketplace. The bourgeois life, capitalism, Mencken’s “booboisie” and David Brooks’s “bobos”—all have been, and still are, framed as being responsible for everything from financial to moral poverty, world wars, and spiritual desuetude. Countering these centuries of assumptions and unexamined thinking is Deirdre McCloskey’s The Bourgeois Virtues, a magnum opus that offers a radical view: capitalism is good for us.

&gt;McCloskey’s sweeping, charming, and even humorous survey of ethical thought and economic realities—from Plato to Barbara Ehrenreich—**overturns every assumption we have about being bourgeois**. **Can you be virtuous and bourgeois?** Do markets improve ethics? Has capitalism made us better as well as richer? **Yes, yes, and yes**, argues McCloskey, who takes on centuries of capitalism’s critics with her erudition and ***sheer*** scope of knowledge. Applying a new tradition of “virtue ethics” to our lives in modern economies, she affirms American capitalism without ignoring its faults and **celebrates the bourgeois lives we actually live**, **without** supposing that they must be lives without ethical foundations.

- Intel Core-i5 3470T (35W)

- 128GB Samsung 850 Evo mSATA
- 2TB Samsung Spinpoint M9T
- Akasa Galileo Case

You can do just as well buying newer Zotac ZBOX or NUC. They are silent, take 2.5 HDDs, and will run just about anything you can throw at them. Check out https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0179S50UU/

The only real downside to these mini PCs is heat. I built this 3 years ago and both the ZBOX and NUC ran way too hot. They still do run pretty hot, just a limit being in such a small enclosure

**Edit: For anyone interested in building a low profile thin-mini ITX build I highly recommended checking out more current parts like the [ASUS Q170 1151 motherboard](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813132834) and a 35W T-Series Sky Lake or Kaby Lake processor like the 6300T/6400T/6500T/6600T/6700T.

IMO Georgia's book covers everything you'll need for the exam (specifically exploit development and POC modification).

The Metasploit book is cool, but since you don't really get to use it in the exam lab (you only get one Metasploit ""lifeline"" to use) it may not be worth picking up right now.

First things first, let's do some basic troubleshooting to determine what is exactly wrong. I'm assuming it has once worked for you and the screen not working is a recent of sorts development here, so correct me if I'm wrong and we'll go from there. You should be able to plug the game in and it operates as normal with the exception of the screen, you'll hear the sounds as you coin it up, the start button lights work correctly, and it will play ""blind"" as we call it. If that's the case, you're more than likely a culprit of an aging and failed monitor chassis. If you're handy with a soldering iron and not afraid of high voltage, there's ways to repair them good as new. If you're more of a artsy type or non-engineery person, luckily there's a few options available to you for repair. 

1.  Send your monitor chassis off for repair. There's a few people out there that do excellent repair work on these older monitors, Chad from [ArcadeCup](http://www.arcadecup.com/), and [Buffett](http://thearcadebuffett.com/) are two I'd recommend to anyone needing quality work. If you send in the chassis to them they'll want it to be separate from the tube. If that's the route you go, let me know and I'll gladly help you safely remove the chassis from the tube for the low low cost of an alcoholic beverage. The downside to this option is that it can be a very long turn around time, these guys are getting busier as the hobby continues to grow in popularity. It's also going to cut into your pocket to the tune of 150-200 bucks plus shipping. 

2.  There actually are a few local options for professional service too, I can't vouch for them as I haven't used either of them (A mechanic never goes to the mechanic), but they're [Shaffer Distributing](http://shafferdistributing.com/contact-us/), and the goddamned place I can't remember the name of, sorry. Now grain of salt, it's been years since I know they offered that service, so if they say nay, maybe ask around at Gotcha Gapon or Old North, not sure if they have a guy or not. 

3. Buy a new monitor! This also requires some deal of mechanical aptitude, as it involves getting the old one out and doing some rudimentary hooking up and modifying to get the new one to fit. It's also not as simple as running to Microcenter and getting a 19"" LCD monitor to throw in there. Modern arcade LCD replacements are still fairly pricey, but they can be purchased online from eBay, Amazon, and specialty arcade sites for around [$300 bucks](https://www.amazon.com/Monitor-Complete-Replacement-Upright-Replacement/dp/B00F1YQA8G/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1481258526&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=arcade+monitor). Would I recommend this route? Not personally, no, it just doesn't have that same eye-melting CRT radiation 1982 feel that the original monitors had. Unfortunately they don't make a new 19"" CRT, so if you're not a filthy purist like me, go for the new tech! 

4. Take a chance and learn a new skill. There's sooooo much information out there at our fingertips right now, there's thousands of YouTube tutorials, millions of forum posts, and tons of helpful guys out there that will assist you with any silly little question you have about your burgeoning interest in arcade restoration. Plus, if you fix your first monitor, you get exclusive access to the super secret Arcade Repair and Restoration Club, and I'll personally teach you the handshake!

5. I stopped doing housecalls a long time ago, but if you get in over your head with this, send me a PM.

The list of ingredients on Amazon for [Ultra Sheer SPF 30](https://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Ultra-Dry-touch-Sunscreen-Ounces/dp/B00008IHO3?th=1) is:

* Avobenzone (2.0%)
* Homosalate (7%)
* Octinoxate (7.5%)
* Octisalate (5%)
* Oxybenzone (3.0%)

On the [Neutrogena website](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/ultra+sheer-+dry-touch+sunscreen+broad+spectrum+spf+30.do) it says the ingredients are:

* Avobenzone (3%)
* Homosalate (8%)
* Octisalate (5%)
* Octocrylene (4%)
* Oxybenzone (4%)

According to [skinacea](http://www.skinacea.com/faq/sunscreen/s01-sunscreen-stability.html#.WEHmGdIrKCg), avobenzone is unstable and is further destabilized by octinoxate. The 1st set of ingredients includes octinoxate but the 2nd set of ingredients don't. Also octocrylene will stabilize the avobenzone if the percentage of octocrylene is higher than avobenzone, which is true for the 2nd set, but octocrylene is not used at all in the 1st set.

I'm also in Canada and the sunscreen I bought matches the 2nd set of ingredients. Does anyone have the sunscreen with the ingredients matching the first set?

ETA: your MUA source mentions that they recommend having the octocrylene to be at least half the percentage of avobenzone, so yay, I think my sunscreen is safe to use.",17,,xPawreen,,,2016,12,2016-12-02T21:38:48,t5_2tbbg,0,SkincareAddiction,http://reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/5g5r8w/c/dapq784,019bb7609e57f1e6561a2ac43a43c9c2f95ac20a854eea0865be53f1ef1562ca

The 15x15mm shin is the correct size but the thickness matters as well. I believe Phawx used a 1mm thick shim and there was a noticeable bump in the keyboard, I used a 0.8mm thick shim and it cools very well with a barely noticeable bump. There shouldn't be a problem using anything from 0.5 to 1mm, but I wouldn't go out of that range.

I wouldn't remove the joystick cables from the motherboard. They are tough to get aligned again when reconnecting them. Use some tape to hold them in place on the board. 

Two specific things to keep in mind: there are two screws that hold the main board in that are shorter than the rest, note where you remove them from. Also watch the input selector switch when you're reinserting the main board, make sure it's aligned with the switch on the case.

 Other than that you should be in good shape, it's not too tough of a mod. Just keep your screws organized, and take your time putting it back together and you'll be fine.

Also silver is not going to be worth the added cost. It does conduct better, but only marginally so. You can spend the extra money, but I'm not sure it's worth it. Copper is around $2.60/lb while silver is around $240/lb. While the conductivity of copper is 386 W/m*k and silver is 407 W/m*k. So you get an approx 5% increase in cooling for a nearly 100x increase in price.

""Programmed to Kill"" by David McGowan 

&gt;The specter of the marauding serial killer has become a relatively common feature on the American landscape. Reactions to these modern-day monsters range from revulsion to morbid fascination-fascination that is either fed by, or a product of, the saturation coverage provided by print and broadcast media, along with a dizzying array of books, documentary films, websites, and “Movies of the Week”. The prevalence in Western culture of images of serial killers (and mass murderers) has created in the public mind a consensus view of what a serial killer is. Most people are aware, to some degree, of the classic serial killer ‘profile.’ **But what if there is a much different ‘profile’-one that has not received much media attention? In Programmed to Kill, acclaimed and always controversial author David McGowan takes a fresh look at the lives of many of America’s most notorious accused murderers, focusing on the largely hidden patterns that suggest that there may be more to the average serial killer story than meets the eye.** Think you know everything there is to know about serial killers? Or is it possible that sometimes what everyone ‘knows’ to be true isn’t really true at all?

You can always read Amazon.com reviews to get a sense of a book, and many times get the ""highlights"" or ""cliffs notes"" version you mandate. https://www.amazon.com/Programmed-Kill-Politics-Serial-Murder/dp/0595326404

These are the dreaded german cockroaches.  Do NOT use bug bombs or any chemical you can buy in stores.  Those chemicals will just force them deeper into the walls and make them harder to kill.

There is a product called Advion, originally made my DuPont; that is what you need.  https://www.amazon.com/Advion-Syngenta-Cockroach-Bait-Tubes/dp/B002Y2GNVM

It comes in a gel-filled syringe and you apply tiny little drops of it, as small as you can make them, everywhere you see them.  Usually door sills near warm, dark and damp places like the water heater closets, kitchen cabinets, and bathrooms is where they like to hide.  Go crazy and leave the gel drops everywhere.  In 3 days or so youll see dead bugs absolutely everywhere.  More than you thought possible - it will be gross.

If you live in a multi-unit apt, you need to let your landlord know, since all units need to be treated.

They really shouldnt charge you for this since any tenant could have caused it and the roaches may have been in the building for a long time.

I'll try and directly answer this but I may go off on some detail. Also these details will be summarized so anyone reading this, you can pick it apart. It isn't meant to be exact.

&gt; What exactly is a packet?

Its just a chunk of data. This chunk of data contains all types of things it will need to get where it is going safely. Source. Destination. Checksums. Settings. And of course the data within. In TCP this chunk of data can be up to 64 kilobytes. However before this chunk of data hits the physical wire, it has to be split up into its Maximum Transmissible Unit. Which is just a fancy way of saying ""this is the agreed upon maximum chunk of data size for this network"". Typically the MTU is _around_ 1500 bytes. It is also known as a ""frame"" since an MTU of 9000 is also called ""jumbo frames""

Think of an MTU size like the gears in a car. A lower MTU size is like a lower gear. It gets you going faster, since once you have 1500 bytes of data you can fire that packet off, instead of sitting around waiting for 9000 bytes of data to fill up.

The downside to this is that each packet sent requires a series of interrupts. And interrupts can be costly (especially back in the day!). When an interrupt fires, it goes to the kernel and says ""HEY! I NEED SOMETHING DONE!"". The kernel says ""alright little buddy, lets get you what you need."" and then the kernel assigns a core to handle the interrupt. When the interrupt is being handled, _nothing_ else on the core gets done. It has a full lock on that core until the job is done or the interrupt itself (depending on the type of interrupt) is interrupted itself. And yes before you ask, certain types of interrupts cannot be interrupted.

So you can imagine back in the day of single core systems, this could really suck. Because if you have a single core servicing interrupts for 1500 MTU sizes instead of 9000 MTU sizes, you're servicing 6* as many interrupts. Which means your processor literally stops what it is doing to handle the interrupt, and then once done goes back to what it was doing. I could go into kernel preemption and interrupting interrupts but I won't. Too long.

These days interrupts aren't so bad as we have many many cores to service them. If you've ever run into the irqbalance service, it is responsible for basically round-robining interrupts across all cores (cat /proc/interrupts to see).

&gt; how do different linux OSes manage them

All linux distros use some version of the Linux kernel. How the network is managed can vary little to a lot from version to version. There are also local settings for the kernel. Things in sysctl like packet buffer sizes. You also have hardware buffers like the NIC ring buffer/NIC buffer/send/receive queue (I've seen it referred to as all of those) which is set by tools like ethtool. Then you have deeper level settings like congestion algorithms, congestion windows, etc etc. There are entire books written on this. Two of my favorites are [Understanding the Linux Kernel](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Linux-Kernel-Third-Daniel/dp/0596005652/) and [Understanding Linux Network Internals](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Linux-Network-Internals-Networking/dp/0596002556/). But to crudely summarize the answer here, the kernel manages all of this for the most part. 

&gt; how this packet of data is physically sent over the internet

Basically, buffers and interrupts (hardware/software). These chunks of data sit in a buffer somewhere until either the buffer fills up, and the owner of the buffer sends an interrupt to the kernel saying ""hey I need attention, I'm running out of buffer space, can you pick up some packets for me and free up some space?"" to software just repeatedly polling a memory address to check for new packets in said buffer. Things like kernel bypass allow userspace programs to read the memory directly on the NIC. But usually a packet goes from the NIC, to the kernel, to the application.

The internet is really just a big conga line of buffers and interrupts. There are tons of places a packet can be dropped. Throughout the process a packet moves through the ""7 layers of the OSI model"" moving from the physical medium all the way up to the end user application.

The details of how this works are endless. I've literally spent 5 hours in interviews talking about all this and how it works.

Learn more left hand patterns... learn more right hand licks.  Obviously that's a simplified answer because there are turn arounds and jazz-blues progressions to learn and plenty else, but that really is the heart of it.  It seems like when most people post some blues stuff they find very impressive it's literally just someone soloing over (or even just comping) 12-bar blues.

One good resource I'm familiar with first hand is [this Mark Harrison book](https://www.amazon.com/Blues-Piano-Leonard-Keyboard-Instruction/dp/0634061690).  It covers a lot of basses dabbing at a lot of different ideas form different blues styles.  It's probably a decent jumping off point and Harrison always does a great job of explaining *why* things work from a theory standpoint so you can actually apply it rather than just memorizing a few stock ideas.

I also hear good things about [this Tim Richards book](https://www.amazon.com/Improvising-Blues-Piano-Tim-Richards/dp/0946535973/ref=pd_sbs_14_img_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=SJA29EXW3ED145H0QATG).  I don't have first hand experience with this one, though I'd like to pick it up to review and safely recommend since I've heard it mentioned quite often.

I personally think that it's much more efficient to have a pretty firm grasp on a style and it's theory before trying to transcribe.  A lot of people say to jump straight to transcription, but they are taking for granted all of the skills they already possess that make that a good tool for advancement.  It's like telling someone to learn how to paint like a famous painter by telling them to just copy their works even if they don't know how to even hold the paintbrush yet.  Learn the basics and some of the broader ideas first and then you'll find transcription much easier and much more fruitful.  People have a bad habit of giving advice for where *they* are rather than where the *learner* is.  I'm not immune, but I at least try to be aware of the phenomenon and take it into account when helping people get started on stuff.

I think by the time you've worked through a book like the Mark Harrison book you'd pretty much recognize at least the bare bones of a lot of blues ideas and have a much easier time transcribing them.  And even beyond just transcribing recordings, Youtube is a great resource these days with people throwing out tons of great licks in short videos.

Also, don't feel like you need to be limited to stealing ideas from pianists.  There's a ton of material out there for guitar and while you might not be able to do everything they do (like bends) you can emulate tons of licks.  Obviously other instruments too... but guitar is super ubiquitous.

I tried to buy this shower curtain with a credit card, but they only accept these weird golden tokens.  I asked where I can get some, and the representative said I have to go to 69th street and use crisp new dollar bills at the machine there.  I asked how I can get there, and they mailed me a paper transfer I could use that day.  I get to 69th street and I put in a $20 bill and I got back $15 change in dimes and 3 tokens.  I turned in the change to the homeless man standing by the machine who asked me if I had any change, just as the change was coming out of the machine.  So anyway, I tried to order it again with my 3 tokens, but the curtain costs 4 tokens.  I asked how I can get another token, and the person said they were on lunch break and hung up on me.  Two months later I get 6 shower curtains in the mail, which I assume was a mistake.  I kept two and gave the rest to my neighbors.  They're using them to cover their quads and dirt bikes when they don't ride them on Broad street in the middle of the day.  The curtains only cover about half of my shower, so I still have to rely on another mode of coverage for the rest.  Also, some homeless dude shows up in my shower every now and then, but he's cool, he just wants to hang out.  Sometimes he tells me a story about how his shower broke down and how he needs to use my shower because he has an important job interview and has to pick up his kids at the same time.  Only 4 stars because I tried to get in the shower this morning and the curtains closed in my face as I was walking up to it, so I had to wait for the next one.

When this happens, your breasts can push the cups away from your body, thus adding tension to the band. To check for sure, you can try it on upside down with the cups in the back. A properly fitting band will feel rather snug in these conditions.

Slipping straps will not be as bad if you size down in the band, but [these things](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01A5BQABQ/ref=mp_s_a_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1480947444&amp;sr=8-5&amp;pi=AC_SX236_SY340_QL65&amp;keywords=bra+strap+holder&amp;dpPl=1&amp;dpID=41JOvB2RNIL&amp;ref=plSrch) are pretty handy if they keep on slipping. There isn't much to do if you really do have sloping shoulders.

If you have a Nordstrom somewhere not too far, it's one of the best places to start. I suggest you try both 34E and 32F, especially in brands which tend to run a bit larger than true to size, such as Freya or Fantasie. Your straps hurting your shoulders and neck indicate that they take on more weight than they're made for to compensate for a band that is too loose, which is why I really think you should give a chance to 32s.

As far as shape goes, the Wacoal French Garden is rather deep for a moulded cup and it's wide in terms of cup width, so I would guess you have wide-ish but short-ish roots with small to average projection, but please take it with a grain of salt. This bra also seems to run very tight in the band for a 34, according to Bratabase, it does run more like a small-ish 32 than like a true 34.

On Bratabase I see a couple of models from Gossard, Passionata, Chantelle, Parfait by Affinitas, Prima Donna and even Wacoal that could work, both moulded and unlined. Moulded Panache and Freya models could also work. So really what you have to do now is go to the store and try some bras on! :)",9,,spacenb,,,2016,12,2016-12-05T14:40:10,t5_2s8kf,0,ABraThatFits,http://reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/5glkvp/c/data94n,f149c4c260a1a14969786690865dd03d099715d239eb57c8ee618a8b5305efd8

It looks like you are talking about the book *Guns, Germs, and Steel* by *Jared Diamond*.

The book over the past years has become rather popular, which is hardly surprising since it is a good and entertaining read. It has reached the point that for some people it has sort of reached the status of gospel. On /r/history we noticed a trend where every time a question was asked that has even the slightest relation to the book a dozen or so people would jump in and recommending the book.  Which in the context of history is a bit problematic and the reason this reply has been written. 

Why it is problematic can be broken down into two reasons: 

1. In academic history there isn't such thing as one definitive authority or work on things, there are often others who research the same subjects and people that dive into work of others to build on it or to see if it indeed holds up. This being critical of your sources and not relying on one source is actually a very important history skill often lacking when dozens of people just spam the same work over and over again as a definite guide and answer to ""everything"".  
2. There are a good amount modern historians and anthropologists that are quite critical of *Guns, Germs, and Steel* and there are some very real issues with Diamond's work. These issues are often overlooked or not noticed by the people reading his book. Which is understandable given the fact that for many it will be their first exposure to the subject. Considering the popularity of the book it is also te reason that we felt it was needed to create this response. 

In an ideal world, every time the book was posted in /r/history, it would be accompanied by critical notes and other works covering the same subject. Lacking that a dozen other people would quickly respond and do the same. But simply put, that isn't always going to happen and as a result, we have created this response so people can be made aware of these things. Does this mean that the /r/history mods hate the book or Diamond himself? No, if that was the case we would simply instruct the bot to remove every mention of it, this is just an attempt to bring some balance to a conversation that in popular history had become a bit unbalanced.
It should also be noted that being critical of someone's work isn't that same as outright dismissing it. Historians are always critical of any work they examine, that is part of they core skill set and key in doing good research. 

Below you'll find a list of other works covering much of the same subject, further below you'll find an explanation of why many historians and anthropologists are critical of Diamonds work.

## Criticism on *Guns, Germs, and Steel*

Many historians and anthropologists believe Diamond plays fast and loose with history by generalizing highly complex topics to provide an ecological/geographical determinist view of human history that. There is a reason historians avoid grand theories of human history: those [""just so stories""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-so_story) don't adequately explain human history. It's true however that it is an entertaining introductory text that forces people to look at world history from a different vantage point. That being said, Diamond writes a rather oversimplified narrative that seemingly ignores the human element of history.


**Cherry-picked data while ignoring the complexity of issues**  

In his chapter ""Lethal Gift of Livestock"" on the origin of human crowd infections he picks 5 pathogens that best support his idea of domestic origins. However, when diving into the genetic and historic data, only two pathogens (maybe influenza and most likely measles) could possibly have jumped to humans through domestication. The majority were already a part of the human disease load before the origin of agriculture, domestication, and sedentary population centers. 
This is an example of Diamond ignoring the evidence that didn't support his theory to explain conquest via disease spread to immunologically naive Native Americas. 
  
A similar case of cherry-picking history is seen when discussing the conquest of the Inca.

&gt; Pizarro's military advantages lay in the Spaniards' steel swords and other weapons, steel armor, guns, and horses... Such imbalances of equipment were decisive in innumerable other confrontations of Europeans with Native Americans and other peoples. The sole Native Americans able to resist European conquest for many centuries were those tribes that reduced the military disparity by acquiring and mastering both guns and horses.

This is a very broad generalization that effectively makes it false. Conquest was not a simple matter of conquering a people, raising a Spanish flag, and calling ""game over."" Conquest was a constant process of negotiation, accommodation, and rebellion played out through the ebbs and flows of power over the course of centuries. Some Yucatan Maya city-states maintained independence for two hundred years after contact, were ""conquered"", and then immediately rebelled again. 
The Pueblos along the Rio Grande revolted in 1680, dislodged the Spanish for a decade, and instigated unrest that threatened the survival of the entire northern edge of the empire for decades to come. 
Technological ""advantage"", in this case guns and steel, did not automatically equate to battlefield success in the face of resistance, rough terrain and vastly superior numbers. The story was far more nuanced, and conquest was never a cut and dry issue, which in the book is not really touched upon. In the book it seems to be case of the Inka being conquered when Pizarro says they were conquered.

**Uncritical examining of the historical record surrounding conquest**  

Being critical of the sources you come across and be aware of their context, biases and agendas is a core skill of any historian. 

Pizarro, Cortez and other conquistadores were biased authors who wrote for the sole purpose of supporting/justifying their claim on the territory, riches and peoples they subdued. To do so they elaborated their own sufferings, bravery, and outstanding deeds, while minimizing the work of native allies, pure dumb luck, and good timing. If you only read their accounts you walk away thinking a handful of adventurers conquered an empire thanks to guns and steel and a smattering of germs. No historian in the last half century would be so naive to argue this generalized view of conquest, but European technological supremacy is one keystone to Diamond's thesis so he presents conquest at the hands of a handful of adventurers.

**The construction of the arguments for GG&amp;S paints Native Americans specifically, and the colonized world in general, as categorically inferior**. 

To believe the narrative you need to view Native Americans as fundamentally naive, unable to understand Spanish motivations and desires, unable react to new weapons/military tactics, unwilling to accommodate to a changing political landscape, incapable of mounting resistance once conquered, too stupid to invent the key technological advances used against them, and doomed to die because they failed to build cities, domesticate animals and thereby acquire infectious organisms. When viewed through this lens, we hope you can see why so many historians and anthropologists are livid that a popular writer is perpetuating a false interpretation of history while minimizing the agency of entire continents full of people.

Great video. You might also crosspost to /r/cars. I bet they'd dig it. 

My wife and I do a YouTube car show called Crossthreaded. We subscribed and retweeted and facebooked it. 

We're by no means experts, but two things you can really easily do:
 
1. Grab a lavalier mic. The cheap (~$30), wired ones on Amazon really help get all the ""room"" out of your audio. We have two of [these](https://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-Omnidirectional-Condenser-Lavalier-Microphone/dp/B002HJ9PTO/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1481986468&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=lavalier) going into a H4N. 

2. Be a little more dynamic. If you talk to the camera *exactly the same way* that you'd talk normally to a friend, for some reason it looks wooden. 

More shots of the car would have been good like the other poster said.

Do you know if she prefers wooden or metal needles? If not, I'd really recommend the [try it set](http://www.knitpicks.com/needles/TRY_IT_Needle_Set-Rainbow_and_Nickel__D90803.html) from knitpicks. Once she decides what she prefers (wooden or metal needles), you could plan to get her the full set to complete her gift. Circular needles are great - you can use them for so many knitted things - blankets, hats, socks... I only ever use my circular needles now. Interchangeable ones are very convenient. I would highly recommend those. 

As for some other ideas, a [yarn winder](https://www.amazon.com/KnitPicks-Yarn-Ball-Winder/dp/B015HR7X9G/ref=sr_1_4?s=arts-crafts&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1481039195&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=yarn+winder) is an invaluable tool to have. I don't know why I waited so long to get one. You might be able to find one at your local craft/yarn store if you don't want to order online.

Bear in mind, I'm from a STEM major, so some of this is stuff I've used for math and other related classes that you might not need.

1) [Uniball KURU TOGA Mechanical Pencils](https://www.amazon.com/Uni-Ball-KuruToga-Mechanical-Pencil-Starter/dp/B0026ICM1E) - These are hands-down the best mechanical pencils I've ever used. It has a mechanism that rotates the lead as you lift up the pencil (I think? or maybe as you write...) so you get a sharp, clean script nearly all the time. My only gripe is I lose the eraser caps a lot, and if you don't have them on it's difficult to click more lead. The ""Roulette"" model might be different. 

2) [TOPS Engineering Computation Pad](https://www.amazon.com/Engineering-Computation-Letter-Sheets-35500/dp/B001J87JTM/ref=sr_1_2?s=office-products&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1481818479&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=engineering+paper) - I actually take my in-class notes on my Surface Pro (highly recommend it), and use my next recommendation for practice problems, but I use this paper for my hand-in assignments. I don't like ruled paper for any kind of computation work, and with plain paper I tend to veer off and don't get clean lines. With this paper, though, I can see the grid on the backside through the front, allowing me to get a clean look without thick lines muddying up the aesthetics. This isn't *necessary*, but for me it makes my work easier to read and organize, and it often times is the only green paper in the homework pile so it's easy to pick out as well!

3) [NUboard A4 Dry Erase Notebook](https://www.amazon.com/NUboard-NGA403FN08-A4-size/dp/B00V47UVK2/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_1?s=office-products&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1481818704&amp;sr=1-1-fkmr1&amp;keywords=Cansay+nuboard) - My wife bought this for me for my first semester because I was going through so much paper to do practice problems, and because I hated standing up to do work on a bigger dry erase board. It's the size of a normal notebook with transparent sheets overlapping the dry erase panels, and your notes will (more or less) stay on the board until you erase them. By this I mean that you can do some notes or problems, close the book, shove it in your backpack, and when you open it it will be as you left it. This thing changed my studying habits, and I use a lot less paper now.

Here's some other random things I didn't think of before I realized I need them in the moment. I try to keep these things in my backpack most of the time:

Surge Protector - I do all my studying in the library, and if I don't get there early, all the desks with outlets get snatched up quickly (especially near midterms and finals). I ended up picking up a cheap one at Micro Center and keep it in my backpack in case I need to sit somewhere further away. Also, it helps others that aren't close to one either. :)

Noise-Cancelling Headphones - I study in the ""absolute quiet"" floors, but even then some people make some noise just shuffling papers, zipping-unzipping stuff, eating lunch, etc. You don't need the Bose fancy ones; anything that keeps the noise out (and, I should mention, your own music IN) will work. 

Chegg/Wolfram Subscription - These saved my academic butt so many times. Wolfram might not be necessary if you're only taking one math course as a GEP requirement, but if you're taking up to Calc2 or 3 it's great. It can solve integrations and derivatives, but, more importantly, it will also show you a step-by-step solution. Chegg, however, I think is worth it for nearly any class. I've only had one or two textbooks whose answers weren't on there, and for the others it was a lifesaver. Professors will sometimes not post solutions or answers to problems in class or on homework, and books will often only have the answer in the back. Chegg, however, not only has the answer, but, more often than not, has step-by-step solutions. I used this all the time for two things specifically: 1) Check my homework before I turn it in to make sure I understood the processes (and got the answers right), and 2) doing practice problems from the book that the professor didn't address or post solutions for. 

Hope this helps!",15,,Boohyabuddha,,,2016,12,2016-12-15T16:31:44,t5_2qh3z,0,college,http://reddit.com/r/college/comments/5ihw87/c/db8cz38,31549c8196c1230b3267aff80b1458f04d85f5d381fa3002b82a88e66ada5abc

At least at first (for the homework), you should use felt tip for all the reasons mentioned. As you go into further lessons, and line/ellipse practice becomes a small daily routine, using ballpoint is probably a good idea as those exercises tend to kill pens.

However any practice is better than no practice, so if you're unable to get a felt tip for whatever reason, that's not a reason to stop practicing.

This isn't the sub for helping you with other stuff so I'll focus on the bag. Uh, go to /r/self or whatever for all that other stuff. The first half of your post contains irrelevant information that to me appears to be a call to help - we're not equipped to handle anything but backpacks and travel/living tips here. 

Regarding bags, good brands are osprey, jansport, and swissgear. They will be extremely durable and still hold their quality despite you getting them secondhand. You don't need fancy pockets or anything - a nice big bag that can fit a laptop, a towel, your underwear and toothbrush, etc. I'm an expert at being broke as fuck and traveling, and I got by just fine without super packable stuff. Two pairs of cheap walmart underwear, a shitty 1$ walmart toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, etc. Walmart is awesome. 

When you leave your house take as much with you that you already own as you can. It sounds like you won't be job hunting but instead, er, self teaching? Not sure what your income source is. Anyway, grab your toothbrush, toothpaste, 2 pairs underwear, a pair of jeans, a pair of shorts, a couple tshirts, and one long sleeved shirt if you have room. Dunno what kind of shoes you have, grab the most versatile ones though, and if you have flipflops, stuff'm in the bag as well. If you have a laptop, bring it and the cable. Grab your phone's charging cable. That should be all you need. If you don't have a laptop, get a library card and use the library computers, or [get a cheap as fuck chromebook](https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11-6-Inch-Dual-Core/dp/B019G7VPTC/ref=sr_1_5?s=pc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482994679&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=laptop&amp;refinements=p_36%3A2421886011). 

You mentioned being a digital nomad. Below is a vomit of links, study hard. Your best bet to go from 0 to making income through your laptop is web development. That means HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Ignore javascript frameworks like angular, react, and backbone for now, instead focus on understanding the basic of how to build an unstyled and barely functional page in HTML, move on to understanding how to style that HTML with CSS, and then learn about how Javascript can manipulate HTML (manipulate the DOM) and change CSS. jQuery makes a lot of this easier but try to avoid it as long as you can to ensure you understand as much basic javascript as possible. See [my blog](http://www.blog.calebjay.com) for my journey to becoming a web developer from being broke as fuck. 

Study in libraries and see if your city has free study areas. For example, many of the first floors of sky scrapers in San Francisco are 'free study areas' with wifi. If you don't have these, use your library. 

If you can afford it, a gym membership is an excellent way to guarantee a shower for yourself every day. They also have lockers, see if you can pick up a lock at a resale shop, if not you may have to blow 20$ on one at the gym. Anyway it's a great place to lock up your stuff for a day and get clean. I like 24 Hour Fitness because I can go in whenever, like if I'm sleeping nearby and need to shit I can just waltz in at 2am, poop, fill up my waterbottle, warm up, and head back out to the park. 

Food, if you have access to a microwave (your library might have one) get a cheap tupperware from walmart so you can boil oatmeal in the microwave. That + a jar of peanutbutter will keep you full as fuck and not too stringbean hobo-ish. If you somehow have access to a stove, rice + beans are your friend. Buy the beans dry and soak'm overnight, then boil them for a couple hours in the day, that's a lot of calories. A bottle of olive oil is great for fats. Salt + pepper is cheap and is great seasoning, if you can steal any spices from your house, steal the curry powder and garlic powder. If you try to eat out you will lose all your money right away. Just stock up on foods you can carry in your backpack and make meals. When I was down I'd just have my backpack full of cucumbers, tortillas, peanut butter, tuna packages (not tins), and walmart deli ham. It all packs tight, is efficient in calories/weight, moderately healthy, cheap, and doesn't need to be refrigerated (ham lasts ~week be careful though).

I've used these in the past to control a cable box thats hidden in a closet, or cheap ""mood lighting"" rgb led kits found on amazon. 

A good test would be to aim a working tv remote at it, sometimes these receivers have a small led that lights up to confirm its receiving commands.

I've accomplished pretty amazing things with the method--most notably hiking up Mount Kilimanjaro shirtless last year in January.

You can see a [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YeIRMK_pXk) about it if you're interested.

If you want to learn the method there is a 10-week course online that will keep you to a schedule as you train, but it's not really necessary if you don't want to splurge on it.

Between the Herbalife-style products being marketed to you by that one aunt, to the infomercials with the weird exercise equipment that doesn't work and cost your $60 savings on your birthday, to knowing the $40/mo for a gym would be impossible on your budget, to not walking outside because that's how your one friend got mugged, it felt like you tried a million things to lose weight.

Now that I'm doing financially better, I'm testing out cheap fitness bands and programs along with CICO (and a food scale) to see what poor people would be more likely to try, since I have that experience from my past.

**What they need first:**


* Food scale (**$20** for bare minimum scale in a dept store)


* Showing them where/how to get *decent* to *good* running shoes, by showing them seasonal sales. (FILA shoes in my area run **$20-25**/avg). Keeping it simple, since everyone knows how to walk.


* MyFitnessPal for calories ($0, I pick this one for a reason)


Then they need some apps or gadgety things to make them feel like they bought something to get ahead. Or the free equivalents. I'm going by android apps since I don't know any poor people who could afford any sort of iPhone.


**[Google Fit app ($0)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.fitness)**

Pros:

* Free.

* Quick download - No wait like you would have buying a fitness tracker online.

* Tracks steps in the background, no need to open up to track.

* Syncs with MFP to give calories (Add app, then set as Step tracking source)

* Auto-tracking can pick up bouts of running, biking, and walking, with maps.

* Shows you what percent of people you were more active than in your area. (You were 99% more active than people in LA last week, with 123,000 step count)

Cons:

* Your auto-tracked path won't show up until 30 mins later, Google Fit needs time to ""think"" about your GPS path.

* Calorie timing shows to your timezone in your timeline, but calories seem to be pushed based on Google HQ time (PST). So if you are east coast, you get your 9pm-midnight calories put into the next day.


**[Xiaomi Band 1s](https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-professional-store-1S-Band/dp/B019Z5UZ8M/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482091579&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=xiaomi+band+1s) ($22.99, can be found cheaper on [Gearbest](http://www.gearbest.com/smart-wristband/pp_263275.html) if you can wait)**

Pros:

* Heart rate and step counter for dirt cheap

* Shows step progress to your goal if you lift your hand up.

* Has SMS, phone, app, etc alerts available to buzz at you to check your phone.

* Has a wake-up alarm.

* Can make some feel like they ""moved up"" since they now have a fitness tracker ""like everyone else.""


Cons:

* No screen display, just 3 LED lights

* Overcounts a bit. Lower your exercise calorie consumption to 30-50% rather than 50-75% because of this

* App display is simpler than Fitbit's.

* Heart rate is on demand. You can get a $2.49 app called [Mi-Band Tools](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.zdenekhorak.mibandtools) that can let you set heart rate, specific vibration app alerts, and even a smart alarm. It works with all Mi Bands.

**[Wokamon($0)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wokamon.android)**

Pros:

* Tamagotchi-type game where steps give you XP to raise alien critters.

* Syncs with Fitbit.

* Syncs with Google Fit (and through that, Mi Bands)

* Free

Cons:

* No online discussion community, so you'll have to figure out the little parts of the game yourself.


I'll test one more one day, which is the [Xiaomi Band 2](http://www.gearbest.com/smart-watches/pp_362705.html?wid=21). Looks like it'd be a good ""cheap"" Fitbit Charge HR replacement with an actual screen on it. I didn't pick it first since its non-sale price is around $40, and that's a huge amount for the super-poor. Might be good for someone starting around black Friday when it goes down below $25, though.


Its taken me so many months to research and try all this but it was worth it. Now I have a back-up plan if times ever get tough again. And I can show others that don't have much cash how to lose weight and get active without a gym membership. :)",6,,CoffeeCreamCinnamon,,,2016,12,2016-12-18T20:22:44,t5_2wyxm,0,fatlogic,http://reddit.com/r/fatlogic/comments/5iut2g/c/dbcqb0g,075c27189139bb3558538b3c0d99943ebcc59c9d5be0ae2646c8ee628d71efd0

My parents used to own a fur and leather business and my dad taught me how to repair a lot of different things. You'll need some leather glue. Places like Tandy sell it but I'm sure you can get it on Amazon. I'll get a link for you shortly but I'm in mobile. 

You'll also need another price of similar colored leather about the size of the hole. I'm not sure where this spot is but I feel confident that since you're on r/sewing you can fix up the lining, because you'll need to open up an area nearby to get behind the tear. Cut the leather to a piece a little bit bigger than the hole and place it behind the tear. 

Add some glue in between the two pieces and then paste the torn part back on top. You'll need to use something to push the edges together closely, a seam ripper or tweezers would work. Also put a tiny bit of glue in the rift between the two pieces and smooth it out with your finger. After you let it dry, you can fix up the finish a bit with spray (which I will also find a link to) but be careful because black isn't black... you don't want a big spot with a different shade. Hope this helps! I'm happy to answer more questions if you have them and I can try to find photos too, I know I took some of the process at some point.

In my opinion though, it goes so much faster than full pencil drawings and it gets much more impressive and dramatic results.

One of the easiest techniques is to actually work 'backwards' from a traditional graphite drawing. You may want to pick up some ['Vine' / 'Willow' Charcoal sticks](https://www.amazon.com/Winsor-Newtown-Artist-Charcoal-Pkg-Medium/dp/B00251CL1S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482979494&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;keywords=vine+charcoal&amp;psc=1) These are **very** soft but lightly toned pieces of charcoal. You'll scrub one over the entire piece of paper and use a tissue to smooth it resulting in a gray toned background. Here you won't be starting with a pure white sheet of paper. 

From there you'll make a gesture drawing of what you'd like to draw with a lighter charcoal pencil (2H or the gray pencil farthest to the right in your drawing tin). After, you'll go in with an eraser and erase out the light areas to *almost* bring back the white of your paper (those pink rectangle erasers you use/used in school are great for this). After that, you can actually dive in and start shading. You'll start by shading with your lightest charcoal pencils and work your way up to the darkest shades (in your tin work right to left with the gray pencils) Your lightest highlights you can achieve by using a piece of chalk or a [white charcoal pencil](https://www.amazon.com/Charcoal-White-Pencils-2-Pkg-2B/dp/B004BPOZAG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482980624&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=white+charcoal) These will be the absolute **lightest** parts of the image, so don't go overboard. 

From there, just darken and lighten areas until you're satisfied with it. 

Some stuff you might want to pick up =

You'd spray this after every day that you work on the drawing. (But don't spray it until you've erased out all of the highlight areas!) As the name suggests, it is workable so you can still erase out some of it, but it won't be as forgiving.

This is the stuff you spray on the final drawing. You're done and you don't want to change anything anymore. You can also use really cheap aerosol hairspray if you want to save money or you don't need a UV-safe protective coating. I've used this in the past - [Horrible Hairspray-Great cheap Fixative](https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/aqua-net-professional-hair-spray-extra-super-hold-3-unscented/ID=prod5458027-product)

Those brown colored pencils and sticks are Conte crayon. They're very similar to charcoal but are made from clay usually. (These are awesome for doing gesture drawings or faces!) I work with these more similar to a graphite pencil rather than charcoal. You can also buy brown toned paper/newsprint to use with them. 

Also, I want to add, be careful when you sharpen any of these pencils. Go slowly and be soft with them or you can crack the charcoal inside and it'll just fall out. I've found [these](https://www.amazon.com/General-Pencil-All-Art-Sharpener-S6503BP/dp/B0018N80XW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482980964&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=general+pencil+sharpener) work better than other pencil sharpeners when it comes to charcoal. You can also simply scrape the pencil end with an Exacto blade - I've never broken a pencil doing it this way.

Those brown colored pencils and sticks are Conte crayon. They're very similar to charcoal but are made from clay usually. (These are awesome for doing gesture drawings or faces!) I work with these more similar to a graphite pencil rather than charcoal. You can also buy brown toned paper/newsprint to use with them. 

Also, I want to add, be careful when you sharpen any of these pencils. Go slowly and be soft with them or you can crack the charcoal inside and it'll just fall out.

In my opinion though, it goes so much faster than full pencil drawings and it gets much more impressive and dramatic results.

One of the easiest techniques is to actually work 'backwards' from a traditional graphite drawing. You may want to pick up some ['Vine' / 'Willow' Charcoal sticks](https://www.amazon.com/Winsor-Newtown-Artist-Charcoal-Pkg-Medium/dp/B00251CL1S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482979494&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;keywords=vine+charcoal&amp;psc=1) These are **very** soft but lightly toned pieces of charcoal. You'll scrub one over the entire piece of paper and use a tissue to smooth it resulting in a gray toned background. Here you won't be starting with a pure white sheet of paper. 

From there you'll make a gesture drawing of what you'd like to draw with a lighter charcoal pencil (2H or the gray pencil farthest to the right in your drawing tin). After, you'll go in with an eraser and erase out the light areas to *almost* bring back the white of your paper (those pink rectangle erasers you use/used in school are great for this). After that, you can actually dive in and start shading. You'll start by shading with your lightest charcoal pencils and work your way up to the darkest shades (in your tin work right to left with the gray pencils) Your lightest highlights you can achieve by using a piece of chalk or a [white charcoal pencil](https://www.amazon.com/Charcoal-White-Pencils-2-Pkg-2B/dp/B004BPOZAG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482980624&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=white+charcoal) These will be the absolute **lightest** parts of the image, so don't go overboard. 

From there, just darken and lighten areas until you're satisfied with it. 

Some stuff you might want to pick up =

You'd spray this after every day that you work on the drawing. (But don't spray it until you've erased out all of the highlight areas!) As the name suggests, it is workable so you can still erase out some of it, but it won't be as forgiving.

The nuclear launch chain is what scares the shit out of me the most about the constant decline in the quality of senior officers.

It takes critically thinking and principled people to reject an order like this.

The current officer system actively works against these type of people advancing.

I'm popular gun writer Josh Wayner of The Truth About Guns fame. In addition to rewriting the book on rifle barrel length, helping the disabled exercise their constitutional right to bear arm, and winning medals at the National Matches, I moonlight as a novelist. 

Since I can't personally thank all of you for the amazing work and support you've given me and each other during this season of WINNING, I am instead extending to all my readers on TTAG and my friends and fellow Pedes here on T_D a gift in the form of my new novel, Savage State. The free edition is for Kindle.

Mods, I messaged you several days ago and got no response so please understand that I'm not trying to make a sale here. This is 100% free and will be free until Friday. I want to give something that I made to those who have made me feel great again. If it was a simple image, I'd just share it, but I'm a writer and this is how I have to give away my creation. I know its on Amazon, but that's what I got and it isn't my first choice either. I'm not making money and neither are they.

Anyways, I don't want anything back from any of you. This is my gift to my friends and I don't expect a thing in return. You have all given me and each other a great gift by saving our country this fall and I hope this makes your Christmas a bit better. Don't do anything but simply enjoy it.

About the book: I wrote Savage State during a hard time in my life and it means a great deal to me. I didn't even want to publish it, but I decided it the right thing to do. The story takes place in Michigan, just not the Michigan you'd recognize. 

I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say if you want a good, very long read that includes brutal warfare, genocide, militant lesbians, drinking, moral and political philosophy, the struggle of addiction, love and loss, and lots of humor, then you'll enjoy this quite a bit. I worked hard to make this as detailed and accurate as possible in nearly every way. 

As a side note, this book will melt snowflakes by the first page, so keep it away from those tender angels in your life lest they get woke.

In closing, have a very Merry Christmas, my dear, dear friends. I love each of you and I wish I was able to do more. I guess we will all just have to settle for WINNING EVERY DAY FOR THE NEXT EIGHT YEARS NO BRAKES. 

Merry Christmas, Pedes!

We already have a lagless way to play melee on monitors. The problem is melee players are pretty particular about lag and decent monitors are expensive. It saves a ton of space but 1k+ is a lot of money if you want to have like 10 setups.

One of the reasons melee is so uniquely successful at a local level is because setups are cheap as fuck so you have people like me who can buy 4-5 full setups for the price of 1 monitor or console and can host a tourney anywhere or make sure there's always enough setups for friendlies.

That said a melee re release would still being melee to a new audience, hopefully it just isn't laggy.    ",58,,housefromtn,,,2016,12,2016-12-07T12:58:54,t5_2qiep,0,smashbros,http://reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/5gz68j/c/daw8t3w,8f8d9eb28445551033f7eac8f87fb104ca1c5fabfbd9c713a91438a97a084874

So don't give up, there are tons of others who have been in your situation.

Personally, I usually approach two things: signal flow and user interface. You'll want to fully understand what gets send where and how to find that place in your software.

You'll want to have a basic understanding of what MIDI data is and what the difference between MIDI, an analog audio signal and a digital audio signal is.

Oversimplifying a little bit MIDI is a data protocol that sends information - usually information like notes being played, at what velocity etc. or controller data (MIDI CC). This data is not to be confused with an audio signal. The Akai keyboard for example uses the MIDI protocol to communicate with Reaper. 

Now since MIDI does not contain any audio, but you want to make music, there is something needed to make an audio signal out of the MIDI data you can play on the Akai keyboard. For this, you can use any soft- or hardware synth, sampler etc. These programs/hardware will use the incomming MIDI data to trigger oscillators or play a sample - usually at a certain pitch, depending on the MIDI note's data. 

It looks like you already figured some of this out, but didn't quite understand how it worked. Now, the software synthesizers work exactly how you imagined: They are loaded into Reaper as Plugins (usually in VST-format, but can be JS, AU, or other). For this to work, you'll have to tell Reaper where to find them. So I suggest you install them into a common folder and tell Reaper where to find that. (Options-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Plugins-&gt;VST-&gt;Add folder via ""Open"", than ""Rescan"".)

The octapad can output both, MIDI and audio. Now it really depends on what you want to get from it. Do you want to sounds from the octapad? Or do you just want to use it as a controller to trigger some sampler plugin in Reaper? Depending on that, you'll either need a [MIDI to USB interface](https://www.amazon.com/VicTsing-Cable-Converter-Keyboard-Adapter/dp/B00ACGMOA6/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482371577&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=midi+interface) or a [audio to USB interface](https://www.amazon.com/Behringer-U-PHORIA-UM2-BEHRINGER/dp/B00EK1OTZC/ref=sr_1_4?s=musical-instruments&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482371614&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=audio+interface). There are also interfaces that do both, audio and MIDI. And also interfaces with more fancy features like 

* multiple inputs (audio for synth/mics/guitar or MIDI),
* (multiple) outputs (to attach speakers to)
* zero-latency monitoring
* phantom power for condenser mics
* better pre-amps for less noise when recording
* etc.

Your computer probably even has an audio interface built in without you ever having thought about that. It'll probably not have many features, will not support phantom power, will have not gain adjustment for incoming signals etc, but it could work with your octapad if it has a line-in.

I'm happy to help, but your questions are very vague. Just try to tinker. Experiment, create basic rhythms, work with audio and with MIDI, explore ever feature of Reaper, bit after bit, and you'll soon feel much more comfortable. Getting comfortable is the most important step, since you'll want Reaper to be your laboratory, your tools, an empty canvas. At that point, you'll be able to truly focus on the music.

First, the existential vacuum is real when leaving the Church and so is the excruciating loneliness. You're not alone and you can make it through. For me, a big part of the answer was just giving it time (cliche, I know, but still true) and just surviving the long, miserable days that followed my loss of faith.

Second, reading books helped. Lots of books from others that have previously dealt with these existential questions. Some recommendations are:

The back has a great long overview of many possible kinks and a chart for you to map out your experience and limit levels with each one. Also has a glossary of more books. 

Also i'm new to relationships in general but to really learn how to make a woman feel good you might want to look into She Comes First. As you'll see from reviews even couples who've been together a long time really got 'energized' by the book. Also good at dispelling many myths around female sexuality that both men and women might think. https://www.amazon.com/She-Comes-First-Thinking-Pleasuring/dp/0060538260/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483221177&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=she+comes+first",7,,Remus90,,,2016,12,2016-12-31T21:54:00,t5_2r9tk,0,BDSMcommunity,http://reddit.com/r/BDSMcommunity/comments/5lb5tf/c/dbuhv9j,14629d4da6dd23f15186b9e39f23950886d74d6a67f1414bb7478b4823c0f16c

The advantage of this is easily swappable batteries, so if one runs out of juice you can just pop in another. Also, batteries by nature degrade over time, so mods with built in batteries will eventually perform poorly if not die outright. 

I'd recommend an [iStick Pico kit](https://vapenw.com/istick-pico-kit-by-eleaf), and juice from [Blue Dot Vapors](http://www.bluedotvapors.com/collections/eliquid). I haven't bought juice in a while since I make my own but they're my favorite juice vendor for the cheap price range, and pretty much anything from them should be delicious. Some might need to ""steep"" though - basically let it sit for a few days to cure. They do have presteeped juice though. 

Make sure to be educated about battery safety. NEVER, EVER NEVER NEVER EVER NEVER carry a loose 18650 in a pocket or bag because something like keys or coins could short the battery, causing it to essentially explode violently. [18650 cases](https://www.amazon.com/Battery-Waterproof-Storage-Holder-organizer/dp/B00IJB3E82) are cheap and convenient. 

It's generally recommended to always charge 18650's via an external charger, like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Nitecore-Digicharger-EASTSHINE-Battery-Charger/dp/B00KW2ZDHQ/ref=pd_lpo_23_tr_t_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=J4M7EHHKQBDBCRR1P29H) or [this](https://www.amazon.com/Efest-LUC-V4-Universal-Battery/dp/B00HWMFB9Y/ref=sr_1_1?s=aht&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483041407&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=luc+v4). The Pico does have a USB charging port, and for everyday use it's probably fine, but it might possibly, maybe, not be 100% safe to leave it plugged in for long periods of time. See [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/4qa3nx/pico_internal_usb_charging_testing_and_analysis/) and [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/4xdjfi/important_update_to_evic_and_pico_usb_charging/). It's probably fine though. 

Or just get him a [Juul](https://www.juulvapor.com/). I've never tried one, want to though, but from what I hear it's about the closest experience to actually smoking, and it's simpler too. The only downside is buying the pods. I think there are ways to refill them with juice though. 

Also, just search around.

I just walk around looking for cherry/apple/maple etc. I try to collect as many branches that I might be able to use. Then I split them down the center. Most of the time, you can make a spoon from each half. I try to use branches that are bigger than 4"" inches or so.

I like to draw a rough shape of the spoon on the wood. [I use a hook knife to carve out the bowl](https://www.amazon.com/Morakniv-Carving-Knife-Carbon-Steel/dp/B00343VCCK), It takes some getting used to, but it works very nice. It's a little difficult to sharpen though.

Then with a hand saw, I cut out as much wood as possible. I also make a couple relief cuts to make carving around the neck easier. Next [I use a draw knife](https://www.amazon.com/Flexcut-KN16-5-Inch-Draw-Knife/dp/B000ZRV5MK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482127316&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=5%22+draw+knife) to shape the handle. I also use a good sharp knife. The handle is probably the easiest part to carve, but it's easy to make it off center from the bowl. 

The key is keeping the tools razor sharp at all times. After the initial sharpen, you should constantly hone the edge. This is most commonly done on a leather strip that's been loaded with a waxy honing compound. Honing is considerably easier/faster than sharpening, and keeps a wicked edge, but you still need to hit the stone every so often. All you need to do is wipe each face of the edge across the leather, wiping away from the edge of the blade.
 
Instead of using expensive sharpening stones, you can also just tape some sandpaper to some glass/granite. But I totally recommend the DMT diamond steel blocks. A coarse, and fine, will coast you about $100, but they work great.

It generally takes me about 4-6 hours to carve a spoon. I try to always finish in a single day, otherwise the wood will become dry, and harder to carve. I'll put the spoon in a plastic bag with some of the wood shavings to sit overnight so it doesn't lose much moisture.

I also like to make things on a wood lathe. Like whistles, spinning tops, mushrooms, containers, bowls, trays, baseball bats, mallets, wands, etc.
It's a lot of fun, and there's little stress in getting it right. There's no ""right"" shape of a mushroom, just go wild.

My first 2 retrievals had good numbers - I think 13 and 15. Ended up with a mc from the second. Never had anything to freeze, but a lot of that had to do with quality factors from MFI, as well as a clinic that didn't have a great lab and didn't do PGS. Stims were antagonist protocol. (gonal + luveris)

I switched REs, and he switched me to Menopur, but still antagonist protocol. My retrieval numbers went way down. We were batching for PGS, and suddenly started getting only 6 or 7 eggs at retrieval. We did FOUR batching cycles, ended up with only one PGS normal out of 8 or so blasts, and transfer failed. The RE was recommending donor eggs, and I was convinced the protocol changes with the increased LH were the issue. There were also some doubts I had about their PGS testing, because he convinced me we needed to test on Day 3, for a transfer on day 5, since we never had day 5's frozen before.

So, new RE. He put me on microdose lupron flare protocol, and retrieval numbers jumped back up. I've done two cycles with him - one with 12 retrieved and one with 18. We have 3 PGS normals from those two cycles with him, testing was done on day 5. (I think we had either 7 or 8 blasts tested). So it's a major improvement, and in 2 cycles we achieved three times what we had from the previous 4 cycles.

My current RE said ovarian response can be cyclical and it's possible that for RE #2 they were just in a down cycle. In particular, my left ovary was not responding at all and RE #2 said it was done. My last retrieval I had 10 follicles in the left, so he was totally wrong there.

Current RE also said the flare protocol can be very helpful for low response, and it was for me.

We also did HGH - though I've basically taken that from cycle 5 onwards. So it's hard to know if it helps, but it doesn't hurt.

I also took acai based on [this study](https://www.ccrmivf.com/blog/ccrm-study-finds-that-high-doses-of-acai-berry-can-improve-ivf-outcomes/). I used [this one](https://www.amazon.com/NOW-Acai-Liquid-Concentrate-16-Ounce/dp/B0033T89EO/ref=sr_1_1_s_it?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1501876381&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=acai+liquid) from amazon. I used it a few weeks before and then during stims.  Also CoQ10.

I would get a second opinion in your shoes. I really don't think IVF#2 should be your last shot with your own eggs. If I had listened to my second RE, I would probably be on donor eggs and sperm, when in reality we have 3 perfectly normal embryos frozen now. Having only 2 embryos to test is just a crapshoot - you can't say all embryos will be bad based on just 2. And the first IVF is always a guessing game in terms of protocol, etc. And I think the flare protocol is a good move, possibly with adding in HGH. 

Also, get your husband on some supplements and clean up his living. Sperm quality has got to play a factor too, and it won't hurt either way. Plus, it's no fair if you have to do everything :)

But so true. 

Actually - you all may be too young to remember it, but the very worst cast of this happened when I was reasonably young, and they released an animated movie called *Watership Down* - a very good movie, I might add. 

It was an animated movie about rabbits and it was released as a kid's movie. The advertisement they used made it *look* like it was for **young** children. 

A whole generation was inadvertently traumatized ... ��

The movie is most definitely not for young children. It features brutal, gruesome deaths; mass killing (by gassing) of a whole warren; another warren that has institutionalized rape run by a rabbit version of the Gestapo. This, in the 1970s.

Your headphones and computer are a FCC Part 15 device, and must accept all unwanted interference by law, but that doesn't mean he's not a nice guy who likes solving problems like that.

Onto further diagnosing. Something is acting as an antenna for you, it could be the headphone wire, or any of the other numerous cables running into your computer.

With the electrical wiring in your house being the longest wire that the computer is connected to, I would start with your computers power cord, then the headphones, but it won't hurt to do both.

In regards to other comments here, 4 watts is the legal maximum on CB, for amateur it is 1500 watts. Also, the police will do nothing for you. It's a waste of yours and their time to try. You can try the FCC, and they would probably tell you to talk to the neighbor first, which takes us back to the top of this comment. But ultimately, the FCC is responsible for things like this.

Sort of, the infection started much earlier, and [the full on creation of ""communist post-modernism"" in this country commenced after they achieved their higher priority goal of diplomatic recognition](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0983426406/) in 1933, first year of FDR's administration, which of course was ridden with Soviet agents.  To no one's surprise that particular effort was liquidated [along with the people doing it by 1940](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willi_M%C3%BCnzenberg), but more than enough had been set in motion by then.  One of the reasons the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) paid attention to cultural centers like Hollywood, people they fingered really were subverting the US on orders from Moscow (although they didn't particularly need the orders or pay to do what came naturally to them).

&gt; Lots of communists desperate to ignore the Soviet Union, but not many Nazis left to sweep the third Reich under the rug. That's even leaving aside how the Soviet Union twisted reality at the Nuremberg trials.

Haven't looked at that at all, but here's [Wikipedia on the first thing I naturally searched for](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre#At_the_Nuremberg_trials):

&gt; At the London conference that drew up the indictments of German war crimes before the Nuremberg trials, the Soviet negotiators put forward the allegation, ""In September 1941, 925 Polish officers who were prisoners of war were killed in the Katyn Forest near Smolensk"". The U.S. negotiators agreed to include it, but were ""embarrassed"" by the inclusion (noting that the allegation had been debated extensively in the press) and concluded that it would be up to the Soviets to sustain it. At the trials in 1946, Soviet General Roman Rudenko raised the indictment, stating that ""one of the most important criminal acts for which the major war criminals are responsible was the mass execution of Polish prisoners of war shot in the Katyn forest near Smolensk by the German fascist invaders"", but failed to make the case and the U.S. and British judges dismissed the charges. It was not the purpose of the court to determine whether Germany or the Soviet Union was responsible for the crime, but rather to attribute the crime to at least one of the defendants, which the court was unable to do.

After they unearthed the graves, the Nazis were *enraged* the world officially didn't believe the Soviets had done it.

Back to you:

&gt; That being said, Germany has managed to slip into one form of autocracy or another enough times that you'd think they would have learned not to disregard the possibility of it happening again.

Beautiful pairing of the Louis Michel “Montee De Tonnerre” 1er Cru 2015 with Beef Tartare and grilled sesame bread. The acid and overall richness of the wine was a perfect match for the meat and fat and it really benefited from having some food with it, naturally.

We paired the Moreau-Naudet “Forets” 1er Cru 2014 with a Mouclade and the same grilled bread and unsurprisingly after tasting it all week and dreaming of what to pair with it the wine absolutely crushed it. The acidity of the “Forets” was perfect counterpoint for the rich cream and the brininess of the mussels. That acid quality that was so pronounced tasting it alone seamlessly morphed into the dish while staying very much present throughout with it’s intense lemon quality. Perhaps one of the best food wine pairings of the year so far. Just fucking awesome.

———

Picking the region and wines for this week was tough as I’m realizing finding the best expressions of a region is both subjective and potentially very expensive. We’re going to Basque Country for our honeymoon so this was a good excuse to explore a few more Rioja’s we hadn’t tried yet. I thought the Lopez de Heredia would be a great representation of a classically-styled Rioja and the Remelluri would be an interesting counterpoint as the more modern interpretation of Rioja that has become a classic in it’s own right. This also provided an opportunity to taste a house style wine versus an estate wine and a well aged wine versus something that’s just starting to show it’s potential.

I used [The Finest Wines of Rioja and Northwest Spain](https://www.amazon.com/Finest-Wines-Rioja-Northwest-Spain/dp/0520269217/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1501605151&amp;sr=8-1-spell&amp;keywords=rioja+and+notrhwest+spain) as my guide to select these wines. 

In the book the Bosconia was described as having “more body and riper fruit, and longer life” than it’s Tondonia brother. Also, interestingly the Burgundy shape of the bottle is owed to the fact that the “predecessor was called Rioja Cepa Borgona and included a small proportion of Pinot Noir”. 

Remelluri was in the process of converting to biodynamic winemaking in the 2010 vintage and “The methods applied in the cellar are closer to those of Burgundy” where fermentation is carried out in large oak “tinas or conos and the cap is punched down by foot rather than pumped over” to give it more “polished tannins”. Malolactic is carried out in oak vats with minimal taking place in barrique.

For those interested [Jancis Robinson.com](https://www.jancisrobinson.com/learn/wine-regions/spain/spain/rioja) has nice, general overview of the region.

Notes:

Rioja wines are often characterized as full bodied with strawberry and stewed fruit notes

**R. Lopéz de Heredia Vina Bosconia Reserva 2005**
Pomegranate, walnut paste, roasted eggplant and earth on the nose. Macerated strawberries and cedar on the palate. Medium acidity. I tasted upon pouring and gave it about 30 minutes to breathe before tasting again and it opened up even more with some leather and mushroom notes with more pronounced acid.

**Remelluri Rioja Reserva 2010**
Natural wine funk on the nose. Barnyard, moss, damp cellar, cherries and dried fig. Forest floor and tart cherries on the tongue. Reminds me of Cru Bojo (Lapierre specifically) but with more backbone and tannin. A chewy and dense wine that I think this has some serious aging potential. Finish was a little soft. Medium acidity. Delicious.

I'm very much open to suggestions of regions to target next and specific producers that typify the region the occupy.",8,,rawdealbuffy,,,2017,08,2017-08-01T17:03:57,t5_2qhs8,0,wine,http://reddit.com/r/wine/comments/6qxm73/c/dl0q0qw,4321a880e2027df47fdcd998f953a941a200fbd7fa73133271b86447e8132a5a

Yhdysvaltojen omat virastot, FBI ja CIA ovat itse salakuljettaneet huumeita maahan. Tästä ovat raportoineet nyt edesmennyt Michael Ruppert ja Michael Levine. Ja Afganistanin opiaattituotanto kukoistaa jostain kumman syystä, vaikka maassa on sotatila päällä.

Tästä voidaan päätyä johtopäätökseen, että War on Drugs on pelkkä false flag-operaatio, jonka verholla voidaan teljetä kansalaisia useiksi vuosiksi vankilaan mitättömistä marijuanan määristä ja huumeista, jotka oma hallitus on salakuljettanut maahan.

Edit: War on [Jotain]-operaatiot ovat vain pelkkä kulissi, jonka varjolla USA voi tehdä ihan mitä tahansa. Esim. War on Terrorin avulla USA:n ei tarvinnut julistaa sotaa kongressin kautta Irakille vaan riitti, että Bush ja Powell huomasi satelliittikuvista alumiiniputkia Irakin maaperällä.

Ja kaikki tämä sillä oletuksella, että Pentagonissa ei olisi Eisenhowerin mainitsemaa ""Military Industrial Complex"":a tehtailemassa sotia ympäri maailmaa, että Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Halliburton... saisivat tarvitsemaansa bisnestä.

Tips from a veteran rare breed chicken egg farmer for 11 years and over 300 chickens+ year round:

Haven't read all comments so forgive me if I repeat some tips.

Right now, those chickens are just fine space wise. But, as time goes on, they will *need* more room than the ""other run."" Those chickens will take so many dirt bathes and scratch up the grass that I can almost guarantee the space will just be a dust bowl in a few weeks or months. Judging by the size of your yard, it seems you can expand. Obviously though, not my chickens, not my choice.

The lay boxes never really worked for us. Not the door part anyway. I would say go in the coop and get the eggs but it is too small for that. I say that because assuming your chickens will sit on their eggs, *they will,* they can sometimes be a bit fussy when getting them out from under the hen. With a door we found it didn't really help to *reach* in instead of *be in.* But as of now the coop is small, nothin wrong with that.

Cleaning shouldn't be too bad. Provided you have easy access to the far corners. Clean once every 1-2 weeks, otherwise you get *layers* of poop that don't smell bad on top, but once you dig in, good luck with that. 

Invest in some chicken scratch. Chickens *love* chicken scratch. That's what we used as their kind of ""treat."" Makes them like you more if you give them some every time you tend them.

Collect eggs *every day* once the start laying. Yes, they are a few months off that, but still. Letting a hen sit on her eggs for extended periods of time makes the hen become too attached to the egg, making harder for you to collect them. Also, if you ever here lots of bawking and sqwaking (is that a word?) the hen(s) are probably laying an egg. That, or a predator has been spotted.

As others have said, reinforce the bottom 6-12 inches with small chicken wire and lay more bricks at the bottom to prevent digging.

Heat lamps are most likely necessary in the dead of winter, don't rely on insulation alone with that few chickens. Hell, I had 300+ in *one* (albeit large) coop and some could still die if heat lamps died in the night. 

On the note of heat lamps, if you have them in the coop, *secure them as tight as possible with no chance of them falling.* Heat lamps can be *very* hot, as we found out. One night one fell and started heating up straw in the coop. Eventually the straw set on fire, we were lucky to catch it in time but still lost 4-5 chickens from inhaling to much smoke.

Don't be afraid to shoot any predator you see coming for the chickens. Since you are in a suburban area, a *strong* pellet gun would be ideal. Not some Red Rider BB gun, I mean VERY strong. Talking 1000+ FPS with .177 lead pellets. [The Gamo Whisper Silent Cat is not a bad choice](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0024XEXQS/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_8C.Gzb2JRFJE9) Scaring off predators by voice or something only works that one moment, they will just come back. Killing the predator means it will *not* come back. Just make sure its not someones pet when you shoot! 

That's about all I can think of for now, good luck!   ",8,,Eshrekticism,,,2017,08,2017-08-04T04:28:31,t5_2qh7d,0,DIY,http://reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/6rdspk/c/dl57l7q,f579310c2302985dfa510bbdf94728b2472d6539c08bddf580f0daab955d7994

ESS is a bigger concern with Grudem, imo (edit: also Trump).  That and the whole him being a Baptist thing (but I'm guessing that's not as much of an issue for you).  I've not read any of his ST, so I can't comment on how prevalent it is.  

I had Sam Storms (who like Grudem is a charismatic, Calvinisht Baptist) for undergrad ST and we used baby Erickson.  I thought it was quite good.  It's broadly ecumenical, not reformed, but I found it very clear and balanced.  I'd recommend it if that's the kind of thing you are looking for. 

Actual Reformed options:

* Calvin's Institutes.  Still the gold standard.  The language isn't so bad.  The [Battle translation](https://www.amazon.com/Calvin-Institutes-Christian-Religion-Set/dp/0664220282/) is the best and most readable, but pricy, the older Beveridge Translation is available for much less (and free online).

* [Reformed Dogmatics (Abridged)](http://www.amazon.com/Reformed-Dogmatics-Abridged-Herman-Bavinck/dp/0801036488/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8) by Herman Bavink.  My appreciation for Bavink grows every time I read him.  If you want a ""modern"" author, get Bavink.  This abridged version is much cheaper and more accessible than the full four volume edition.

* Systematic Theology, by Louis Berkhof.  This was for many years the standard ""modern"" Reformed ST., but now that Bavinck is available in English I think that is the better option, not that Berkhof is bad by any means.  The one advantage Berkhof has over Bavinck is that it is [availible for free online and as an ebook.](https://www.biblicaltraining.org/library/systematic-theology-louis-berkhof)

* [Christian Dogmatics: Reformed Theology for the Church Catholic](https://www.amazon.com/Christian-Dogmatics-Reformed-Theology-Catholic/dp/080104894X/) ed. by Allen and Swain. If you are willing to go with a multi-author collection instead of a traditional single-author volume, this is a good option.  Building off of the ideas in Allen and Swains *Reformed Catholicity*, this book lays out dogmatic theology that is both catholic and Reformed.  Many of the heavy hitters of Reformed Theology contribute.  As with most multi-author volumes, some chapters are better than others.

My great grandmother told me about how they did laundry I still remember. She was born in 1899.

They would build a fire and boil a big pot of water once a week and cut up a bar of ""Octagon"" soap to make the wash water. Then the women would wash cloths all day. It was interesting to hear that putting 4 meals on the table and housework required about 12 hours a day hard work to do. I miss her stories greatly. She passed in 94.
